- Includes risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, and production & post-production (P&PP) activities.
- Is integrated with or appropriately linked to the broader quality management system (QMS) / product realization processes.

Core evidence to look for (minimal subset for PASS):
- A defined risk management PROCESS (procedure, section, or flowchart) that references ISO 14971 or clearly equivalent concepts.
- Explicit or implicit statement that the process applies across the device life cycle (not just design).
- Description of the main steps: risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, and P&PP activities (these may be named differently but conceptually should match).
- At least some indication of integration with other QMS processes (e.g., links to design controls, complaint handling, CAPA, PMS, etc.).

Examples of strong PASS evidence:
- A dedicated “Risk Management Procedure” section that defines scope, key activities, and references related procedures.
- A flowchart showing risk management from pre-market through post-market with feedback loops.
- Statements like “This process applies to all phases of the product life cycle…” and “Risk management activities are integrated into design control, change control, and complaint handling processes.”

When to FLAG:
- The document references risk management in general terms, but it is unclear whether all life-cycle phases are covered OR the P&PP loop is vaguely described.
- It appears that risk analysis and control are defined, but their linkage to post-market monitoring is only implied, not clearly stated.

When to FAIL:
- No recognizable risk management process is described.
- The document only addresses a narrow subset (e.g., just risk analysis) without any indication that evaluation, control, or P&PP are part of a defined process.
- No link at all between risk management and other QMS/product realization processes.

Typical OFIs (can still PASS):
- The process is described but not clearly mapped to life-cycle stages.
- Links to related SOPs (e.g., complaint handling, CAPA) exist but could be clearer.

Examples of strong PASS evidence:
- A section assigning top-level responsibility (e.g., “Top Management shall ensure adequate resources, appoint a risk management responsible person, and approve the risk management policy”).
- A documented risk acceptability policy (in this document or by reference) that defines criteria and refers to applicable regulations/standards.
- Description of how management reviews the risk management process at planned intervals (inputs/outputs, actions).

When to FLAG:
- There is a general statement about management “commitment” or “approval” but no clear policy for risk acceptability and/or no description of how suitability is reviewed.
- Responsibility is mentioned in passing but it is not clear who owns the policy or review cycle.

When to FAIL:
- No mention of management’s role in providing resources, approving policy, or reviewing the process.
- No risk acceptability policy (or anything equivalent) can be found or inferred.
- The document suggests risk decisions are made without defined criteria or management involvement.

Typical OFIs (can still PASS):
- Roles and responsibilities could be clearer (e.g., no named role for risk-management oversight).
- The risk acceptability policy exists but is not clearly linked to specific device families or regulatory expectations.
- The management review of risk management is implied (e.g., part of general management review) but could be more explicitly described."

When to FLAG:
- An RMP is referenced, but only a few of the above elements are clearly defined and it is unclear whether the others are captured elsewhere.
- The plan is described only in very high-level terms, making it unclear if it would satisfy ISO 14971 expectations in practice.

When to FAIL:
- No risk management plan is mentioned or described.
- The document suggests risk activities are performed ad hoc without any planning document per device/family.
- Key elements (e.g., risk acceptability criteria, verification planning, or P&PP information flow) are completely absent from the plan or from surrounding text.

When to FLAG:
- Criteria are mentioned but not clearly applied (e.g., risk matrix exists but decision-making rules are vague).
- It is unclear whether all hazardous situations are evaluated or only some.

When to FAIL:
- No evaluation step exists; risk estimation is done but there is no comparison to any criteria.
- Risk decisions appear arbitrary or are left entirely to subjective judgment without reference to policy.

Typical OFIs (can still PASS):
- Criteria are defined but not well documented in this specific procedure.

Typical OFIs (can still PASS):
- Sources are generally defined but could be expanded (e.g., literature or “state of the art” not clearly included).
- Data collection frequency or trending methods are not well specified."
Information review & feedback into risk management,10.3,22,"You are evaluating ISO 14971:2019 clause 10.3 – “Information review”.

Objective:
Determine whether the document requires:
- Reviewing collected production and post-production information to determine its relevance to safety.
- Feeding relevant information back into earlier stages of the risk-management process (hazard identification, risk estimation, risk control, etc.).

Core evidence to look for (minimal subset for PASS):
- A defined review process for collected information (e.g., periodic safety meetings, safety review boards, signal review).
- Criteria or triggers for determining when information is safety-relevant.
- Expectation that new information leads to updates of the RMF (e.g., hazard list, risk estimates, controls).

Examples of strong PASS evidence:
- A “safety review board” or “PMS review” step with defined inputs and outputs.
- Instructions to update hazard analyses, risk evaluations, and RMPs based on review findings.

When to FLAG:
- Review is mentioned but not clearly tied to risk management (e.g., only a generic KPI review).
- It is unclear how often review occurs or how decisions are documented.

When to FAIL:
- No review mechanism is described for production/post-production information.
- Collected data are stored but not analyzed for safety implications.

Typical OFIs (can still PASS):
- Review exists but not all outputs (e.g., changes to risk controls, changes to labeling) are clearly defined.
- Criteria for escalation or re-analysis are vague."
Actions based on production & post‑production information,10.4,23,"You are evaluating ISO 14971:2019 clause 10.4 – “Actions”.

Objective:
Determine whether the document requires, when collected information is relevant to safety:
- Deciding whether action is needed (e.g., CAPA, field safety corrective actions, design changes, labeling updates).
- Implementing those actions.
- Updating the risk-management file and associated documents accordingly.

Core evidence to look for (minimal subset for PASS):
- A decision process for determining when safety‑relevant information triggers action.
- Examples or types of possible actions (e.g., risk assessment updates, design changes, process changes, field actions, safety notices).
- Expectation to update risk assessments, risk management plan/file, and other documentation when actions are taken.

Examples of strong PASS evidence:
- A flowchart from “safety-relevant signal detected” → “evaluation” → “decide on actions” → “implement and document” → “update RMF and related documents”.
- Explicit mention of CAPA, recalls/field safety corrective actions, and communication with regulators as part of potential actions.

When to FLAG:
- Actions are mentioned but it is unclear how they are triggered or how they link back to risk management.
- The document relies wholly on generic CAPA text without specifying the risk-management tie-in.

When to FAIL:
- No process for determining or implementing actions based on safety-related information.
- The system collects and reviews data but does nothing with it in terms of risk management.

Typical OFIs (can still PASS):
- Actions are described but updating the RMF/RMP is not explicitly mentioned.
- The set of example actions is incomplete (e.g., design changes mentioned but not field safety actions)."
