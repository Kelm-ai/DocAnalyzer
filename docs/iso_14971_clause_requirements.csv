4.1,Risk management process,"The organization shall establish, document, implement and maintain a risk management process for the medical device that covers the entire product life cycle and integrates risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control and production and post‑production activities with the quality management system.",1
4.2,Management responsibilities,"Top management shall define and maintain responsibilities and authorities for risk management, provide adequate resources, establish a risk acceptability policy, and periodically review the suitability and effectiveness of the risk management process.",2
4.3,Competence of personnel,"The organization shall ensure that personnel performing risk management activities are competent based on appropriate education, training, skills and experience, and that records of this competence are maintained.",3
4.4,Risk management plan,"For each medical device or device family, a documented risk management plan shall be established and maintained that defines the scope, responsibilities, review activities, risk acceptability criteria, verification of risk control measures, production and post‑production information handling, and change control for the plan.",4
4.5,Risk management file and traceability,"A risk management file shall be established and maintained as the logical collection of records that provides traceability from each identified hazard and hazardous situation through risk analysis, risk evaluation, implementation and verification of risk control measures, and residual risk evaluation.",5
5.1,Risk analysis process,"The organization shall perform and document risk analysis for the medical device, including defining the scope and using a structured sequence of activities in accordance with clauses 5.2 to 5.5, with results recorded in the risk management file.",6
5.2,Intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse,"Intended use of the device and reasonably foreseeable misuse shall be identified and documented, including indications, patient populations, users, use environments and foreseeable patterns of misuse, and used as inputs to risk analysis.",7
5.3,Characteristics related to safety,"Characteristics of the medical device that are related to safety, including qualitative and quantitative properties, limits, tolerances and essential performance, shall be identified and documented as inputs to hazard identification and risk estimation.",8
5.4,Hazards and hazardous situations,"Known and foreseeable hazards and associated hazardous situations shall be systematically identified for all relevant phases of the device life cycle, based on the intended use, characteristics related to safety and other appropriate sources of information.",9
5.5,Risk estimation,"For each identified hazardous situation, the severity of possible harm and the probability of its occurrence shall be estimated using defined scales or methods, including handling of uncertainty and situations where probability cannot reasonably be estimated.",10
6,Risk evaluation,"Estimated risks for each hazardous situation shall be compared with defined risk acceptability criteria to determine whether risks are acceptable or require risk control, and the evaluation and decisions shall be documented.",11
7.1,Risk control option analysis,"For risks that require control, risk control options shall be identified and evaluated, applying the priority of inherently safe design, protective measures and information for safety, and documenting selected measures and justifications when further risk reduction is not practicable.",12
7.2,Implementation and verification of risk control measures,"Selected risk control measures shall be implemented, and both their implementation and their effectiveness in reducing risk shall be verified and documented using appropriate verification and validation activities.",13
7.3,Residual risk evaluation per hazardous situation,"After implementation of risk control measures, residual risk for each hazardous situation shall be evaluated against the risk acceptability criteria, and decisions regarding acceptability and any further action shall be documented.",14
7.4,Benefit–risk analysis,"When residual risk for a hazardous situation remains unacceptable and further risk reduction is not practicable, a benefit–risk analysis shall be performed to determine whether the medical benefits outweigh the residual risks, and the analysis and conclusions shall be documented.",15
7.5,Risks arising from risk control measures,"The organization shall identify and evaluate any new hazards, hazardous situations or modified risks introduced by risk control measures, and shall manage these new or changed risks through the same risk management process.",16
7.6,Completeness of risk control,"A review shall be conducted to confirm that all planned risk control measures have been implemented and verified, and that risk control activities are complete for all identified hazardous situations.",17
8,Evaluation of overall residual risk and disclosure,"The overall residual risk of the medical device, considering all individual residual risks together, shall be evaluated in relation to the overall benefits, and any significant residual risks that remain shall be identified and disclosed in accompanying information such as labeling or instructions for use.",18
9,Risk management review and report,"A final risk management review shall be performed, resulting in a risk management report that confirms implementation of the risk management plan, documents conclusions on overall residual risk acceptability and confirms that production and post‑production activities are in place, and this report shall be approved by appropriate authority.",19
10.1,System for production and post‑production monitoring,A system shall be established and maintained to collect and monitor production and post‑production information relevant to the safety of the medical device and to ensure that this information is available to the risk management process.,20
10.2,Information collection,"The organization shall define and use processes to collect information from appropriate production and post‑production sources, such as production records, complaints, service and repair reports, regulatory reports and relevant literature, in order to detect safety‑related issues.",21
10.3,Information review and feedback into risk management,"Collected production and post‑production information shall be reviewed to determine its relevance to safety, and safety‑relevant information shall be fed back into hazard identification, risk estimation, risk evaluation and risk control activities, with resulting updates recorded in the risk management file.",22
10.4,Actions based on production and post‑production information,"When production or post‑production information indicates that action is required to maintain the safety of the medical device, appropriate actions such as design or process changes, field safety corrective actions, labeling updates or other measures shall be determined, implemented and documented, and corresponding risk management documents updated.",23
