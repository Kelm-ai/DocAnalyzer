  "rationale": "The document provides a formal Risk Management Program (QAP013.01) with lifecycle coverage and integration with the QMS, including risk management planning, the risk management file, hazard analysis, risk estimation/evaluation, risk control, and production/post-production activities. A process map/flow is presented (Figure 1) and the text describes the lifecycle elements (5.1.4). It also references related QMS processes (e.g., QAP012 Design Control) and lists the required artifacts (Risk Management Plan, Risk Management File, Hazard Analysis, Risk Management Report, etc.) and post-production activities (5.12, 5.13). Key evidence is cited from the document sections: scope, lifecycle elements, process map, QMS integration, and artifacts.",
