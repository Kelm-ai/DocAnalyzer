  "rationale": "The document shows explicit, ongoing collection and review of information from the sources listed in ISO14971-10.2-01: production/post-production data, user feedback, supply chain inputs, publicly available information, and state of the art, with periodic reviews and consideration of similar devices. Evidence is found in the Risk Management procedures (Section 5: 5.12 Production and Post-Production Activities; 5.12.1â€“5.12.2.6; 5.13 Periodic Reviews) and cross-references to supplier qualification/management (1.4) and post-market inputs (5.12.1, 5.12.2, 5.12.3, 5.12.4). The acceptance criteria are therefore satisfied with explicit citations.",
  "evidence": [
    "5.12.1 Information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the production and post-production phases to comply with post market surveillance regulations as well as to use the data to provide input to the risk management file for the device being marketed.",
    "5.12.2 Information collected and reviewed about the combination product shall entail the following considerations, at a minimum: 5.12.2.1 Information generated during production and monitoring of the production process; 5.12.2.2 Information generated by the user; 5.12.2.4 Information generated by the supply chain; 5.12.2.5 Publicly available information; 5.12.2.6 Information related to the generally acknowledged state of the art.",
    "5.12.4 If any of these conditions occur, the risk management file shall be reviewed to determine if reassessment of risks and/or assessment of new risks is necessary.",
    "5.13 Periodic Reviews: Periodic reviews of risk management documentation shall be conducted as a post market activity on an annual basis or as specified by the team and documented in the risk management plan or when events that may impact the original risk management decision occur.",
    "5.7.4.2.1 The risk analysis shall identify and document hazards and, for each hazard, the reasonably foreseeable sequences of events or causes; review of the same or similar combination products (internally or externally), adverse event databases, publications, and other sources.",
    "1.4 Where Viking Therapeutics is the product applicant, Viking Therapeutics is responsible for ensuring appropriate risk management processes are applied by design partners and contract manufacturers. Partners, consultants, contract manufacturers or suppliers performing cGMP activities shall be evaluated and approved in accordance with XX-XXX, Supplier Qualification and Management."

  "gaps": [],
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider adding explicit cadence/logs for literature/signal reviews (e.g., quarterly literature reviews, annual state-of-the-art assessments) to strengthen alignment with 5.12.3 and 5.13 and to create traceable literature-review logs.",
    "Include explicit records or templates for supplier quality records and post-market data (e.g., supplier QA reports, service logs, complaint databases) in the risk management file to satisfy the expected artifacts more clearly.",
    "Document dedicated post-market surveillance logs and signal-tracking outputs (e.g., a structured Post-Market Surveillance Log) to demonstrate routine ingestion of external information and ties to risk management decisions."
