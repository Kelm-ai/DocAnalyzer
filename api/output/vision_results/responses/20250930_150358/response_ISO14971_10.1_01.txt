  "status": "PASS",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "rationale": "PMS system/procedures are defined and active/post-production information is to be collected and reviewed. Responsibilities are defined (QA, Product Development, Regulatory Affairs). The document cites methods and sources for post-market data collection (complaint handling, production data, user feedback, supply chain, public information) and requires periodic reviews of residual risk and PMS activity. Evidence references ISO14971/PMS-related clauses in the Risk Management SOP (sections 5.12, 5.2.8, 5.11.1.4, 5.13) and responsibilities in Section 2.",
  "evidence": [
    "5.12.1 Information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the production and post-production phases to comply with post market surveillance regulations as well as to use the data to provide input to the risk management file for the device being marketed. This information is collected in the Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process.",
    "5.12.2 Information collected and reviewed about the combination product shall entail the following, at a minimum: 5.12.2.1 Information generated during production and monitoring of the production process; 5.12.2.2 Information generated by the user; 5.12.2.3 Information generated by those accountable for the installation, use and maintenance of the combination product (as applicable); 5.12.2.4 Information generated by the supply chain; 5.12.2.5 Publicly available information; 5.12.2.6 Information related to the generally acknowledged state of the art.",
    "5.12.3 The information collected shall be reviewed for possible relevance to safety, especially with respect to the following: 5.12.3.1 Previously unrecognized hazards or hazardous situations are present; 5.12.3.2 An estimated risk arising from a hazardous situation is present; 5.12.3.3 The overall residual risk is no longer acceptable in relation to the benefits of the intended use; 5.12.3.4 The generally acknowledged state of the art has changed.",
    "5.11.1.4 The risk management process shall be reviewed as part of the management review; Appropriate methods to collect and review the information in the production and post-production phases have been determined and are in place.",
    "5.2.8.1 At a minimum, data from the complaint handling process, if applicable, shall be used as part of the residual risk analysis."
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "The artifacts listed in the acceptance criteria (PMS Plan, Complaint Handling SOP, Vigilance/Field Action procedures, data pipelines) are not explicitly named as separate, standalone documents in the excerpt; references are to processes (Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process) rather than discrete documents.",
    "No explicit diagram or description of data pipelines; information flow is described in narrative form without a dedicated PMS data architecture diagram."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Create or designate an explicit PMS Plan document and link it to the QMS (to satisfy the 'PMS Plan' artifact requirement).",
    "Develop and approve separate Complaint Handling SOP and Vigilance/Field Action procedures, and map them to the references in 5.12/5.2.8 (PMS inputs and regulatory reporting).",
    "Include a formal data pipeline/data flow diagram showing how production, user, maintenance, supply chain, and public information feed into the risk management system and PMS outputs.",
    "Document the tools and access controls (e.g., QMS, document management system) used to collect, review, and store PMS data (reference QAP001 for document control).",
    "Schedule and document periodic PMS reviews and management reviews per 5.13, ensuring actions are captured in the Risk Management Report."
