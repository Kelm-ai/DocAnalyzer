  "rationale": "The ISO14971-4.1 risk management requirements are addressed by a formal Risk Management Program (QAP013.01) with lifecycle coverage, documentation, and cross-references to related QMS processes. Evidence shows: scope across the product lifecycle (1.2); lifecycle elements (5.1.4); process map evidenced by Figure 1 (5.1.5); risk management file controls (5.3.5); integration with Design Control (5.1.2); and post-production activities (5.12) including risk management continuation and reviews (5.13). Additionally, artifact expectations (Risk Management SOP, process flowchart, QMS cross-references) are supported by sections detailing the Risk Management File, Plan, and cross-references to QAP001/QAP012.",
  "evidence": [
    "1.2 Scope: This SOP applies to the commercial and investigational (clinical) combination products designed, manufactured, and distributed under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions throughout the product lifecycle phases, including product development, technology and design transfer, manufacturing, product surveillance and product discontinuation.",
    "5.1.4 The risk management process includes the following elements throughout the product life cycle: 5.1.4.1 Identifying hazards and hazardous situations associated with the combination product; 5.1.4.2 Estimating and evaluating the associated risks; 5.1.4.3 Controlling risk and monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures; 5.1.4.4 Monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures; 5.1.4.5 Risk reviews driven by new information; 5.1.4.6 Periodic review of identified risks.",
    "5.1.5 Figure 1 illustrates the systemic representation of the risk management process.",
    "5.3.5 The contents of the risk management file (documents, records, trace items, etc.) shall be controlled and maintained in the document management system in accordance with QAP001, Format, Content, Approval and Issuance of Controlled Documents.",
    "5.1.2 Risk management is integrated within QAP012, Design Control as part of product realization.",
    "5.12 Production and Post-Production Activities: 5.12.1 Information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the production and post-production phases to comply with post market surveillance regulations as well as to use the data to provide input to the risk management file for the device being marketed. 5.12.2 Information collected and reviewed about the combination product shall entail the following: 5.12.2.1 Information generated during production and monitoring of the production process; 5.12.3 The information collected shall be reviewed for possible relevance to safety, especially 5.12.3.1 previously unrecognized hazards or hazardous situations are present; 5.12.3.3 The overall residual risk is no longer acceptable in relation to the benefits of the intended use; 5.12.4 If any of these conditions occur, the following activities shall be performed: 5.12.4.1 The risk management file shall be reviewed to determine if reassessment of risks and/or assessment of new risks is necessary; 5.12.4.5 The results of the evaluation shall be provided as input for the review of suitability of the risk management process by top management, as noted in Section 5.13.3.",
    "5.11.1 Prior to release for clinical usage or commercial production of the combination product, the applicant shall review the execution of the risk management plan. This review shall ensure the following, at a minimum: 5.11.1.1 The risk management plan has been appropriately implemented. 5.11.1.2 The risk management process has been appropriately implemented in accordance with this procedure. 5.11.1.3 The overall residual risk acceptability and overall benefit risk analysis have been determined.",
    "Appendix references: The procedure cross-references QAP012 Design Control and QAP001 Document Control for lifecycle and document control alignment.",
    "5.13 Periodic Reviews: 5.13.1 Periodic reviews of risk management documentation shall be conducted as a post market activity on an annual basis or as specified by the team and documented in the risk management plan or when events that may impact the original risk management decision occur.",
    "5.3 Risk Management File: 5.3.1 For the combination product being considered, a risk management file shall be established and maintained throughout the product lifecycle. 5.3.4 The risk management file consists of hazard analysis, risk management plan, risk analyses, benefit risk analysis, risk management report(s), post-production risk management report(s) (when appropriate), and supporting documents."

  "gaps": [],
  "recommendations": [
    "Maintain explicit cross-references in the Quality Manual to QAP012 (Design Control) and QAP001 (Document Control) to ensure ongoing traceability of risk management activities within product realization and document control.",
    "Consider including a formal process flowchart in the Quality Manual to complement Figure 1 and satisfy artifact expectations (process map/flow with all required elements).",
    "Periodically verify that life-cycle coverage remains explicit in all risk management activities as products transition between lifecycle phases, updating the Risk Management Plan accordingly."
