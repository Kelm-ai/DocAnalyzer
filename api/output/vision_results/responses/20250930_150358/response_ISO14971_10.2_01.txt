    "\"5.12.1 Information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the production and post-production phases to comply with post market surveillance regulations as well as to use the data to provide input to the risk management file for the device being marketed. This information is collected in the Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process.\"",
    "\"5.12.2 Information collected and reviewed about the combination product shall entail the following, at a minimum: 5.12.2.1 Information generated during production and monitoring of the production process 5.12.2.2 Information generated by the user 5.12.2.3 Information generated by those accountable for the installation, use and maintenance of the combination product (as applicable) 5.12.2.4 Information generated by the supply chain 5.12.2.5 Publicly available information 5.12.2.6 Information related to the generally acknowledged state of the art.\"",
    "\"5.12.3. The information collected shall be reviewed for possible relevance to safety, especially with respect to the following: 5.12.3.1 Previously unrecognized hazards or hazardous situations are present 5.12.3.2 An estimated risk arising from a hazardous situation is present 5.12.3.3 The overall residual risk is no longer acceptable in relation to the benefits of the intended use 5.12.3.4 The generally acknowledged state of the art has changed.\"",
    "\"5.12.4 If any of these conditions occur, the following activities shall be performed: 5.12.4.1 The risk management file shall be reviewed to determine if reassessment of risks and/or assessment of new risks is necessary. 5.12.4.2 If a residual risk is no longer acceptable, the impact on previous implemented risk control measures shall be evaluated and should be considered as an input for modification of the combination product 5.12.4.3 Consider the need for actions regarding combination products on the market 5.12.4.4 Evaluate the impact on previously implemented risk management activities 5.12.4.5 The results of the evaluation as input for the review of suitability of the risk management process by top management, as noted in Section 5.13.3.\"",
    "\"5.6.3.3.1. The risk analysis shall identify and document the known and foreseeable hazards associated with the combination product based on the intended use, reasonably foreseeable misuse and the characteristics related to safety... 5.6.3.3.1. Review of the same or similar combination products (internally or externally), adverse event (AE) databases, publications, and other sources.\"",
    "\"5.9.5.2. If a residual risk is deemed unacceptable using the criteria established in the risk management plan and further risk control is not practicable, the Applicant may gather and review data and literature to determine if the benefits of the intended use outweigh this residual risk.\"",
    "\"5.13.1 Periodic reviews of risk management documentation shall be conducted as a post market activity on an annual basis or as specified by the team and documented in the risk management plan or when events that may impact the original risk management decision occur.\"",
    "\"5.13.3.The risk management process shall be reviewed as part of the management review following requirements in XX-YYY, Management Responsibility. At a minimum, the review shall include: 5.13.3.1. Risk management process 5.13.3.2. Summaries of responses for critical and high risks 5.13.3.3. Risk profile(s).\"",
    "\"5.2.8 The risk management plan shall include documentation of decisions, based on risk analysis, about what sort of post-market surveillance is appropriate for the combination product. For example, whether reactive surveillance is adequate or whether proactive studies are needed.\"",
    "\"5.2.7.2 Other potential sources of verification/validation information include, but are not limited to scientifically valid characterization studies.\""

  "recommendations": [
    "Formalize a dedicated competitor/alternative therapy monitoring process and logs to explicitly satisfy ISO14971-10.2 expectations.",
    "Maintain explicit literature review logs and post-market surveillance logs as artifacts (in addition to the risk management file) to demonstrate routine ingestion and periodic reviews.",
    "Ensure supplier quality records and service logs are captured and linked to risk management outputs (e.g., hazard analyses, FMEAs, risk management reports) for traceability."
