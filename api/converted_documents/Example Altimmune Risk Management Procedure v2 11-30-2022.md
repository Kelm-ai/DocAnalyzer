| Title: | Risk Management Procedure for Combination Products |

# 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to establish, implement, document and maintain an ongoing
process for risk management at Altimmune for combination products, including identifying
hazards associated with a combination product, estimating and evaluating the associated
risks, controlling these risks, and monitoring the effectiveness of the controls in accordance
with applicable subclauses of ISO 13485:2016 [1], ISO 14971:2019, and taking into
consideration the guidelines provided by ISO/TR 24971:2020.

# 2.0 Scope

This procedure applies to the commercial and investigational (clinical) combination
products designed, manufactured and distributed under Current Good Manufacturing
Practice (cGMP) conditions throughout the product lifecycle phases, including product
development, technology and design transfer, manufacturing, product surveillance and
product discontinuation. This procedure applies to all sites and/or functions supporting
and/or executing cGMP activities.

This procedure establishes and defines processes for identifying and managing quality risks,
safety risks or hazards that can potentially lead to harm. This procedure does not define the
threshold for acceptable risk (or risk index) since this threshold will change based on the
intended use and expected benefit of using the combination product.

Where Altimmune is the product applicant, Altimmune is responsible for ensuring
appropriate risk management processes are applied by design partners and contract
manufacturers. Partners, consultants, contract manufacturers or suppliers performing cGMP
activities shall be evaluated and approved in accordance with QA-008, Supplier
Qualification and Management [6].

Risk management related to drug substance and drug product is out of scope of this
procedure.

# 3.0 Responsibilities

3.1
Altimmune Product Development and Quality Assurance are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this procedure. All functional leads/managers are responsible for
ensuring compliance with the applicable segments of this procedure that are within their
areas of responsibility.

E

Commented [LS1]: Is it desired to use the terms medical
devices and combination products throughout the procedure?
There are cases where both terms are used and cases where
just medical devices are used. Since Altimmune is just
working with a combination product, what is most appropriate?
