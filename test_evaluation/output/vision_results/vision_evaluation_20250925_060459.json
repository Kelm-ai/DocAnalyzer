      "rationale": "The QAP013.01 'RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM' document (Effective Date 26Jun2024) meets most of the acceptance criteria: an SOP exists (document header and Revision History), the scope explicitly covers the entire product lifecycle, a process flow (Figure 1 Risk Management Overview) depicts the required elements (risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, production & post-production activities), and multiple cross-references to QMS procedures (e.g., QAP012 Design Control, QAP001 Format/Content/Approval, QAP011 Training, Post Market Surveillance / Complaint Handling) are present. However, some cross-references use placeholder identifiers (e.g., 'XX-XXX', 'XX-YYY') rather than actual document numbers, and the file as provided does not show an explicit document approval/signature block within the text (only a Revision History entry).

Evidence: (1) The SOP explicitly states alignment to regulatory/standard inputs (ISO 14971:2019, ISO 13485:2016, ISO/TR 24971:2020 and 21 CFR) (Section 1.1; Section 3). (2) The document requires that criteria for risk acceptability be defined and documented in the Risk Management Plan and that Top Management establish acceptable thresholds for residual risk (Sections 2 Responsibilities / Functional Area Management; 5.2.3.2.2; 5.2.3.1; 5.2.5). (3) The SOP requires the method and criteria for acceptability for the overall residual risk be clearly defined and documented in the Risk Management Plan, and details how residual overall risk is to be evaluated (Sections 5.2.6; 5.10; 5.11). (4) The SOP allows RMPs to be developed for specific products or families and calls out that RMPs shall contain scope, responsibilities, and acceptance criteria (Sections 5.2.3.1; 5.2.10; 5.3.4). (5) Accessibility/maintenance of the policy and risk files is mandated via document control and the document management system (Section 5.3.5) and responsibilities for approval/oversight by QA and Top Management are defined (Section 2 and 5.11.1.6). Taken together, these items satisfy the Acceptance Criteria: an approved policy exists in the form of this SOP, regulatory/standard inputs are cited, principles and mechanisms exist to define device-family-specific acceptance criteria (via Risk Management Plan and Top Management thresholds), and the policy/documents are to be maintained in controlled document management systems and assigned to responsible functions (accessible to teams).",
