The document clearly exists and describes an ongoing risk management process covering the device life cycle, and it includes a process flow (Figure 1) that shows risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, and production & post-production activities. The SOP also references related QMS procedures (e.g., QAP012, QAP001, QAP011) demonstrating integration with the QMS. However, some QMS references use placeholder identifiers (e.g., \"XX-XXX\", \"XX-YYY\") instead of specific controlled document numbers and there is no explicit visible signature/approval block or document-control metadata within the excerpt provided that demonstrates final approval/issuance (beyond the Effective Date and Revision History). Because of these uncertainties (placeholders and limited visible document control evidence), at least one acceptance criterion is only partially satisfied, so the overall determination is FLAGGED per your mandatory method.",

      "rationale": "Overview: The submitted SOP QAP013.01 (Risk Management Program) documents a policy/process for establishing risk acceptability criteria and residual-risk evaluation. The document is an approved SOP (Effective Date 26Jun2024) and explicitly references regulatory/standards inputs (ISO 14971:2019, ISO/TR 24971:2020, 21CFR820.30, ISO 13485:2016). It requires that risk acceptance criteria and the method for evaluating overall residual risk be recorded in the Risk Management Plan and risk management file, includes quantitative/qualitative tables for probability, severity, and risk index (Tables 1-5) and defines required actions based on residual risk (Table 6). This satisfies several acceptance criteria: an approved policy exists (as an SOP), regulatory/standards inputs are cited, the policy requires accessibility via the risk management file and document control, and references to RMPs are present. However, one acceptance criterion is uncertain/partially satisfied: the requirement to \"define principles for specific device families where needed.\" The SOP requires that a Risk Management Plan be prepared for a particular combination product or product family and that criteria be specified in the RMP (Section 5.2.10 and 5.2.3.1), but the SOP itself does not contain concrete, device-family-specific acceptability principles or example thresholds \u2014 it delegates that definition to the RMP. Because the clause asks for a policy that defines and documents criteria for risk acceptability and \"defines principles for specific device families where needed,\" and the SOP only mandates that those principles be defined in the RMP (without giving examples or templates for device-family principles within the policy itself), this item is flagged as partially satisfied/uncertain. Summary against each acceptance criterion: 1) Approved policy exists \u2014 SATISFIED (SOP QAP013.01; Effective Date). 2) Cites regulatory/standard inputs \u2014 SATISFIED (References section and Purpose). 3) Defines principles for specific device families where needed \u2014 PARTIAL/UNCERTAIN (SOP requires RMP to define them but does not itself provide device-family principles or examples). 4) Accessible to teams \u2014 SATISFIED/PROVIDED (document control references and risk management file storage instructions). Given the partial/uncertain fulfilment of the device-family principles criterion, overall status is FLAGGED.",
