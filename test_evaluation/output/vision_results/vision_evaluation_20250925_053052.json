Individual acceptance criteria are satisfied as follows: (1) Procedure(s) exist and are controlled \u2014 the document is an SOP (QAP013.01) and states the risk management file and its contents are controlled in the document management system per QAP001. (2) Scope includes life-cycle coverage \u2014 Section 1.2 and 5.1.4 explicitly state applicability across development, transfer, manufacturing, production and post-production/discontinuation. (3) Process map/flow shows required elements \u2014 Figure 1 (Risk Management Overview) is present and its elements match the required risk management steps. (4) References to related QMS processes are clear \u2014 the SOP references QAP012 (Design Control), QAP001 (Document Control), QAP011 (GMP Training), Management Review Process (placeholder XX-YYY) and other QMS inputs.

However, the acceptance criteria request documented management commitment artifacts (for example, management review minutes, resourcing decisions), resource plans, org charts, or training plans/records. Those concrete artifacts are not present in this document: the SOP states responsibilities and references other procedures but does not itself contain management review minutes, resource allocation decisions, organisational charts, or training records.

      "rationale": "I evaluated each acceptance criterion from ISO14971-4.2-02 against the supplied QAP013.01 (Risk Management Program) document. 1) Approved policy exists: the SOP (QAP013.01) is an issued controlled document with an Effective Date (26Jun2024) and Revision history, and the Procedure assigns responsibilities for approval and control of risk management documents (Sections 2 and 5.3.5). However, the provided text does not include an explicit approval signature block or an 'Approved by' entry showing top management/document owner approval of this SOP. Evidence is therefore partial (policy exists and is issued, but explicit documented approval is not visible in the supplied pages). 2) Cites regulatory/standard inputs: the SOP explicitly cites applicable regulations and standards (ISO 14971:2019, ISO/TR 24971:2020, ISO 13485:2016, 21CFR820.30, etc.) and repeatedly references use of state-of-the-art and stakeholder considerations \u2014 this acceptance criterion is satisfied. 3) Defines principles for specific device families where needed: the SOP requires the Risk Management Plan may be developed for a specific product or a family of similar products (Sections 5.2.3.1, 5.2.10) and directs top management to establish acceptable thresholds and to document scope and criteria in the RMP \u2014 this criterion is satisfied. 4) Accessible to teams: the SOP applies to all sites/functions (Section 1.2), requires the risk management file to be maintained in the document management system (Section 5.3.5) and references training and responsibilities (Sections 2, 5.1.8, QAP011). This criterion is satisfied. Because evidence for the first criterion (explicit documented approval of the policy/SOP) is incomplete in the supplied material, the overall status is FLAGGED (partial compliance) rather than PASS.",
