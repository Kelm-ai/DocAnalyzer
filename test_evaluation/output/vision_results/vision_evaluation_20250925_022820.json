The SOP defines a Risk Management Plan and Risk Management File, specifies lifecycle scope (development, transfer, manufacturing, surveillance, discontinuation), integrates with Design Control (QAP012) and other QMS procedures (QAP001, QAP011), and specifies periodic review and post\u2011production activities.
