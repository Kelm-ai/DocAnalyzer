  "rationale": "All acceptance criteria are explicitly addressed. A controlled SOP exists (with document number and effective date) and links to document control. The scope clearly covers the entire product lifecycle, including production and post‑production. A process flow/overview is provided in Figure 1 showing risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, evaluation of overall residual risk, and production/post‑production activities. The SOP is integrated with product realization/design control and references related QMS processes. Minor gaps exist (placeholder document numbers and a typographical error in references), but they do not prevent meeting the clause intent.",
