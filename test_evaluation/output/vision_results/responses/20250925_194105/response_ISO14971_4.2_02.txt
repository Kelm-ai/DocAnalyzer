  "rationale": "The SOP defines a structured policy framework for establishing risk acceptability criteria, cites regulatory and standard inputs, requires inclusion of criteria and overall residual risk methods in each Risk Management Plan (RMP), and provides concrete risk matrices and actions (Tables 5–6). It references state of the art and stakeholder concerns. However, explicit evidence of formal approval of this policy is not visible in the provided excerpt, and device-family-specific principles/thresholds are deferred to product/family RMPs without examples in this document.",

    "Provide the approval page or electronic document control record (per QAP001) showing approvers, dates, and status to demonstrate the policy is approved.",
