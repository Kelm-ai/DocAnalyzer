  "confidence": 0.88,
  "rationale": "The QAP013.01 Risk Management Program SOP documents a clear policy-level framework for establishing risk acceptability criteria aligned to regulations and standards (ISO 14971:2019, ISO/TR 24971, ISO 13485:2016 and 21 CFR 820.30). It requires risk acceptability criteria to be defined in the Risk Management Plan (RMP), includes quantitative/qualitative tables (P1, P2, Severity, Risk Index) and prescribes evaluation of overall residual risk and required actions (Table 6). Document control and storage in the document management system/DHF and responsibilities for QA and Top Management are specified, so the policy is accessible and implementable. However, the SOP explicitly states it does not itself define fixed acceptability thresholds and defers threshold setting to top management/RMPs; there is no explicit, signed Risk Acceptability Policy or unambiguous mapping of Risk Index categories to acceptability decisions (e.g., clear statement that 'Green = acceptable; Yellow = acceptable only with conditions; Red = unacceptable unless approved following benefit-risk analysis'). Also there is limited evidence that Top Management has formally approved specific threshold values or that each RMP must cite the policy and document device-family-specific criteria. These gaps justify a flagged status (policy exists and largely meets ISO 14971 clause 4.2 intent, but requires clarifications and records of approval and threshold definition).",

    "Document header: Document Number: QAP013.01 Title: RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM Effective Date: 26Jun2024",
    "Purpose 1.1: '... establish, implement, document and maintain an ongoing process for risk management at Viking Therapeutics ... in accordance with applicable subclauses of ISO 13485:2016, ISO 14971:2019, and taking into consideration the guidelines provided by ISO/TR 24971:2020.'",
    "References (section 3): '21CFR820.30; ISO 14971: 2019; ISO 12971: 2020; Viking QAP012 Design Control; ISO 62366: 2005' (regulatory/standard inputs cited).",
    "Roles - Management responsibilities: 'Defines and documents criteria for risk acceptability in the Risk Management Procedure. This provides a framework that ensures that criteria are based upon applicable national or regional regulations and relevant International Standards and considers available information such as the general acknowledged state of the art and known stakeholder concerns.'",
    "Roles - Quality Assurance: 'Defines and documents criteria for risk acceptability in the Risk Management Plan according to the process established in this SOP.'",
    "5.2.3.2.2: 'Top management of Product Development, Clinical Development, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance establish acceptable thresholds for residual risk acceptance within this procedure.'",
    "5.2.5: 'Categories of risk and criteria for risk acceptability, in accordance with this procedure, including criteria for accepting risks when the probability of occurrence of harm cannot be estimated. The risk acceptance criteria are based on the following decisions: 5.2.5.1 The risk presented by the current standard of care; 5.2.5.2 The potential health benefits of using the combination product; 5.2.5.3 The generally acknowledged state of the art defined in recognized consensus standards.'",
    "5.2.6: 'The evaluation method and criteria for acceptability for the overall residual risk, considering all the impact of all risks together, shall be clearly defined and documented in the risk management plan.'",
    "Tables included in the SOP (transcribed from images and text): Table 1 'Probabilities of Hazardous Situations Occurring (P1)' (quantitative ranges), Table 2 'Probability of Harm (P2)' (quantitative ranges), Table 3 'Overall Probability of Harm (P)' (matrix mapping P1 & P2 to overall P), Table 4 'Severity' (S0-S5 definitions), Table 5 'Risk Index' (matrix mapping Overall Probability of Harm P and Severity S to color-coded Risk Index: Green/Yellow/Red), Table 6 'Required Action Based on Residual Risk Evaluation' (Red -> Benefit-risk analysis & disclosure; Yellow -> Investigate further risk controls & benefit-risk analysis; Green -> Overall benefit-risk analysis within the Risk Management Report).",
    "5.3.4/.5/.6: 'The risk management file shall include Hazard Analysis, Risk Management Plan, Risk Analyses, Benefit Risk Analysis ... The contents of the risk management file ... shall be controlled and maintained in the document management system in accordance with QAP001 ... The risk management file shall be maintained in the associated combination product design history file (DHF).' (accessibility and document control).",
    "1.3: 'This SOP does not define the threshold for acceptable risk (or risk index) since this threshold will change based on the intended use and expected benefit of using the combination product.' (explicitly defers threshold definition)."
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "No explicit, signed 'Risk Acceptability Policy' artifact or approval signature block shown in the provided SOP extract confirming top management formal approval of specific acceptability thresholds.",
    "SOP text explicitly states 'This SOP does not define the threshold for acceptable risk (or risk index)' leaving thresholds to be set in each Risk Management Plan; absence of a default/organization-level decision (e.g., explicit statement that 'Green = acceptable, Yellow = acceptable with controls/justification, Red = unacceptable unless benefit-risk approved') creates potential inconsistency between RMPs.",
    "Table 5 and Table 6 imply actions but do not unambiguously state which Risk Index values are 'acceptable' vs 'unacceptable' as an organizational policy (i.e., acceptability mapping is not a clear, signed policy statement).",
    "No explicit requirement in the SOP extract that each Risk Management Plan must reference/cite the organization's Risk Acceptability Policy or show evidence of Top Management approval for any deviations (device-family-specific thresholds).",
    "No examples or templates for device-family-specific acceptability criteria or documented process for setting device-family thresholds (principles exist but formal, documented device-family templates or mandatory steps are not shown).",
    "No explicit record or example in the extract showing stakeholder concerns being evaluated/documented as inputs to thresholds (process for capturing stakeholder concerns is described but not mandated or evidenced).",
    "Minor reference anomaly: 'ISO 12971: 2020' appears in References (likely intended ISO/TR 24971:2020) â€” requires correction to avoid confusion."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add or designate a clear, signed 'Risk Acceptability Policy' (either as a named section within QAP013 or a separate controlled policy document) that is explicitly approved by Top Management and retained in the QMS. Include an approval block (name, role, signature/date) and version control.",
    "Explicitly map Risk Index categories to acceptability decisions in the policy (example wording: 'Green = acceptable; Yellow = acceptable only with documented mitigation, risk owner and timescale and requires QA review; Red = unacceptable unless a formal benefit-risk decision is approved and signed by Top Management and Regulatory/Clinical leads').",
    "Require every Risk Management Plan (RMP) to: (a) cite the Risk Acceptability Policy and the version used; (b) record any device-family-specific thresholds or justified deviations; and (c) include Top Management approval evidence when thresholds deviate from the organization defaults.",
    "Provide device-family-specific threshold templates and worked examples (e.g., for differing patient populations/intended uses) to ensure consistent application across products and to implement the clause 'defines principles for specific device families where needed.'",
    "Clarify and record the process for incorporating 'stakeholder concerns' and 'state of the art' into threshold-setting decisions (for example: inputs to threshold decisions should include literature reviews, standard-of-care comparisons, regulator guidance, clinical advisory input and post-market data).",
    "Correct the references list to accurately cite standards (e.g., change 'ISO 12971: 2020' to 'ISO/TR 24971:2020' if intended) and add any market-specific regulations that drive acceptability thresholds.",
    "Include a mandatory field in the Risk Management Report and RMP templates that records the specific acceptability thresholds used, the rationale for those thresholds, and the signatures/approvals from the designated Top Management roles.",
    "Provide training and internal communication to ensure risk acceptability policy is readily accessible to all risk teams (note location in document management system and DHF) and ensure auditors/reviewers can find approval records and RMP cross-references during reviews."
