  "status": "FAIL",
  "confidence": 0.86,
  "rationale": "Assessment against acceptance criteria: (1) PMS system/procedures defined: The SOP requires active collection and review of production and post-production information and states this is handled via a Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process, but it does not define those processes nor reference dedicated PMS/complaint/vigilance SOPs; the document itself is a draft with no approvals/effective date, so the system is not established. (2) Active and passive sources listed: The SOP enumerates multiple production and post-production information sources. (3) Responsibilities and tools defined: While general risk management responsibilities are assigned to QA and other functions, the SOP does not assign specific PMS monitoring responsibilities, cadence, or tools/data pipelines for collection and processing; no complaint handling or vigilance tools/procedures are identified. Expected artifacts (PMS Plan; complaint handling SOP; vigilance/field action procedures; data pipelines) are not present or referenced.",
  "evidence": [
    "Section 8.12.1, Page 28: \"Information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the production and post-production phases... This information is collected in the Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process.\"",
    "Section 8.12.2, Page 28: Lists sources, e.g., \"Information generated during production and monitoring of the production process,\" \"Information generated by the user,\" \"...supply chain,\" \"Publicly available information,\" and \"Information related to the generally acknowledged state of the art.\"",
    "Section 8.11.1, Page 27: \"Appropriate methods to collect and review the information in the production and post-production phases have been determined and are in place\" (as a requirement before release).",
    "Section 3.0 and Role tables, Pages 3–5: \"Quality Assurance Management – Overall responsibility for effective execution and oversight of risk management process... Overall responsibility for the QMS, including the risk management process\" (general RM ownership; no PMS-specific ownership defined).",
    "Section 8.3.4, Page 15: RMF deliverables include \"Post-production Risk Management Report(s) (when appropriate)\" (post-production evaluation noted but no PMS process defined).",
    "References, Section 4.0, Page 5: No PMS Plan, Complaint Handling SOP, or Vigilance/Field Action procedures are listed among referenced documents.",
    "Reviewer comment, Page 13: \"We do not currently have a defined complaint handling process.\"",
    "Approval Page, Page 1 (image): Approval blocks are blank (no signatures, dates); pages are watermarked \"DRAFT\", indicating the procedure is not yet approved/effective."
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "No defined or referenced PMS Plan; the SOP does not provide or point to a dedicated PMS procedure.",
    "No defined or referenced Complaint Handling SOP; reviewer note explicitly states it does not currently exist.",
    "No defined or referenced vigilance/field safety corrective action or recall procedure.",
    "PMS responsibilities (who collects, reviews, frequency, escalation) are not explicitly assigned; only general RM responsibilities are stated.",
    "No tools or data pipelines are defined (e.g., systems, databases, dashboards, thresholds) for post-market data capture, analysis, and feedback into the RMF.",
    "Document is a draft without approvals/effective date, so the system is not established or maintained as required by ISO 14971:2019 clause 10.1."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Issue and approve a dedicated Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) Plan and SOP that define active and passive data collection methods, review cadence, analysis, trending, signal detection thresholds, and interfaces to CAPA and RMF updates.",
    "Establish and approve a Complaint Handling SOP with clear definitions, intake channels, triage, investigation, MDR/MAUDE/eMDR or equivalent reporting assessments, and linkages to vigilance and CAPA.",
    "Establish Vigilance/Field Action procedures (e.g., Field Safety Corrective Action/Recall SOP) covering assessment, regulatory reporting, communication, and effectiveness checks.",
    "Define PMS roles and responsibilities explicitly (e.g., PMS Owner, Data Analyst, Safety Review Board), including tools used (e.g., QMS/CRM database, PMS dashboard), data pipelines, and review frequency.",
    "Reference the PMS, Complaint Handling, and Vigilance SOPs in Section 4.0 (References) and integrate their outputs into Sections 8.11 and 8.12, including how PMS data updates the Risk Management File.",
    "Remove draft comments, finalize content, obtain approvals on the Approval Page, and assign an effective date to establish and maintain the system per ISO 14971:2019 10.1."
