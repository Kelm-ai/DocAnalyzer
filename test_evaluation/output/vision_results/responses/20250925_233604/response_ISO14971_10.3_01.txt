  "rationale": "Partial fulfillment of ISO 14971:2019 clause 10.3. The SOP defines processes to collect and review production and post‑production information, identifies explicit safety-related triggers, requires feedback into earlier RM phases, and mandates updates to RM documents. However, artifacts evidencing implementation (e.g., signal/safety review meeting minutes), a defined signal management or complaint handling SOP, and explicit linkage to CAPA are not present. Comments in the document acknowledge the complaint handling process is not yet defined, and no mechanism is specified to document signal reviews (minutes) or to open CAPA when thresholds are met.",

  "gaps": [
    "No explicit signal management or complaint handling SOP is included; the document itself acknowledges the complaint handling process is not currently defined.",
    "No defined safety review board or requirement to document signal review meetings (minutes) is specified.",
    "No explicit linkage to CAPA or reference to a CAPA SOP when trends/thresholds indicate unacceptable risk; actions are described generically without CAPA initiation criteria.",
    "Approval/signature fields and effective date are blank (document appears draft), and therefore implementation evidence (e.g., review minutes) is not provided.",
    "Escalation governance beyond \"Major risks shall be communicated to Senior... Management\" is not fully defined (e.g., thresholds, timelines, quorum, agenda, and documentation of decisions)."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Establish and reference a formal Post-Market Surveillance/Complaint Handling and Signal Management SOP (define signal detection, triage, assessment, trending, escalation, thresholds, and governance).",
    "Create a Safety Review Board charter and require meeting minutes (agenda, attendees, decisions, actions) for periodic signal reviews and ad hoc escalations; link these to the Risk Management File.",
    "Integrate CAPA: reference the CAPA SOP and require CAPA initiation when safety triggers are met (e.g., unacceptable residual risk, new hazards, trend thresholds); ensure CAPA outputs feed into RM updates.",
    "Define specific documentation requirements for signal reviews (minutes templates) and ensure outputs are filed in the RMF and linked to updated RMP, Hazard Analysis, FMEAs, and RM Report.",
    "Clarify and finalize escalation thresholds, timelines, and responsible roles for safety reviews; include these in the Risk Management Plan and related governance documents.",
    "Approve and issue the SOP (collect signatures/effective date) and train designated roles; implement the referenced PMS/complaints process to operationalize Section 8.12.",
    "Ensure Change Control forms explicitly require assessment of impact on the Risk Management File and capture the update outcome."
