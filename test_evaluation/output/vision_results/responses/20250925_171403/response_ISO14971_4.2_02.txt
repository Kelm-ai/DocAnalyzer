  "rationale": "The SOP establishes a policy for how risk acceptability criteria are to be defined and used. It assigns ownership to management, cites regulatory and standards inputs, instructs that product-/family-specific criteria be documented in the Risk Management Plan (RMP), and includes guidance on evaluating overall residual risk. The document appears controlled and effective (dated), implying organizational approval and accessibility within the QMS. Minor inconsistencies and missing artifacts (e.g., a sample RMP reference) do not outweigh the clear presence of the policy and process.",

  "gaps": [
    "The SOP contains a minor inconsistency: Section 1.3 states the SOP does not define thresholds, while Section 5.2.3.2.2 says top management establishes acceptable thresholds within this procedure.",
    "No explicit approval signatures or approver names are shown in the provided extract; approval is inferred from the effective date and controlled document format.",
    "Standards reference lists \"ISO 12971: 2020\" instead of ISO/TR 24971:2020 (typo) despite mentioning ISO/TR 24971 elsewhere.",
    "Expected artifact linkage: No actual RMP example or template page was provided showing explicit inclusion of risk acceptability criteria referencing this policy.",
    "Stakeholder concern capture is referenced conceptually but not operationalized (e.g., no explicit mechanism described for collecting stakeholder input beyond general statements)."

  "recommendations": [
    "Clarify the location of risk acceptability thresholds to eliminate ambiguity: explicitly state that thresholds are defined and approved in the RMP per product or product family, and adjust Section 5.2.3.2.2 or Section 1.3 accordingly.",
    "Include or reference an approval/signature page (e.g., per QAP001) in the SOP to demonstrate formal approval status.",
    "Correct the reference to ISO/TR 24971:2020 in Section 3 and ensure consistency throughout the document.",
    "Provide or link to an RMP template that includes a dedicated section for risk acceptability criteria and overall residual risk acceptability method, explicitly referencing this SOP’s policy and Tables 1–6.",
    "Add a brief, explicit statement of the risk acceptability policy (e.g., Green generally acceptable; Yellow conditionally acceptable pending further controls/benefit-risk; Red unacceptable unless justified via benefit-risk with disclosure) to improve clarity for teams.",
    "Define a practical mechanism to capture and incorporate stakeholder concerns (e.g., VOC, clinician advisory input) into risk acceptability criteria during RMP development.",
    "Ensure document accessibility is communicated (e.g., location in the eQMS and training requirements) and cross-referenced in onboarding/training materials."
