  "rationale": "All acceptance criteria are clearly met. A controlled SOP exists with document control metadata and revision history; scope explicitly covers the full product life cycle; the process flow is depicted by Figure 1 and reinforced by a life‑cycle list of elements; and the procedure is integrated with related QMS processes (Design Control, Document Control, Management Review, Training, Supplier Management, and Post‑Market/Complaint Handling). The SOP defines and implements risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, and production/post‑production activities, and mandates maintaining a Risk Management File throughout the life cycle.",
