  "rationale": "I evaluated the acceptance criteria for ISO14971-4.1-01 (Clause 4.1) against the provided Risk Management SOP (QAP013.01). The document clearly exists and describes an ongoing risk management process covering the device life cycle, and it includes a process flow (Figure 1) that shows risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, and production & post-production activities. The SOP also references related QMS procedures (e.g., QAP012, QAP001, QAP011) demonstrating integration with the QMS. However, some QMS references use placeholder identifiers (e.g., \"XX-XXX\", \"XX-YYY\") instead of specific controlled document numbers and there is no explicit visible signature/approval block or document-control metadata within the excerpt provided that demonstrates final approval/issuance (beyond the Effective Date and Revision History). Because of these uncertainties (placeholders and limited visible document control evidence), at least one acceptance criterion is only partially satisfied, so the overall determination is FLAGGED per your mandatory method.",

    "Header (Document metadata): \"Document Number: QAP013.01 Title: RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM Effective Date: 26Jun2024\" (Document header)",
    "Section 1.1 Purpose: \"The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish, implement, document and maintain an ongoing process for risk management at Viking Therapeutics for combination products ...\" (Section 1.1 Purpose)",
    "Section 1.2 Scope: \"This SOP applies to the commercial and investigational (clinical) combination products designed, manufactured, and distributed under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions throughout the product lifecycle phases, including product development, technology and design transfer, manufacturing, product surveillance and product discontinuation.\" (Section 1.2 Scope)",
    "Section 5.1.4 Elements: \"The risk management process includes the following elements throughout the product life cycle: 5.1.4.1 Identifying hazards and hazardous situations ... 5.1.4.2 Estimating and evaluating the associated risks 5.1.4.3 Controlling risk and monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures ... 5.1.4.6 Periodic review of identified risks\" (Section 5.1.4)",
    "Section 5.1.5: \"Figure 1 illustrates the systemic representation of the risk management process.\" (Section 5.1.5) — Figure 1 (Risk Management Overview) shows risk analysis → risk evaluation → risk control → evaluation of overall residual risk → risk management review → production and post-production activities (Figure 1 caption/diagram).",
    "Section 5.1.2: \"Risk management is integrated within QAP012, Design Control as part of product realization.\" (Section 5.1.2)",
    "Section 5.3.5: \"The contents of the risk management file (documents, records, trace items, etc.) shall be controlled and maintained in the document management system in accordance with QAP001, Format, Content, Approval and Issuance of Controlled Documents.\" (Section 5.3.5)",
    "Section 5.1.8: \"Appropriate competence and training program requirements are described in QAP011, GMP Training Program.\" (Section 5.1.8)",
    "Section 5.11.1.6: \"Top management of Product Development, Clinical Development, Regulatory Affairs, and QA must approve the risk management report if the benefit risk assessment is needed to justify release of the product according to established risk thresholds.\" (Section 5.11.1.6)",

    "Placeholders: Multiple references use placeholder identifiers, e.g., \"XX-XXX, Supplier Qualification and Management\" (Section 1.4) and \"XX-YYY, Management Responsibility\" (Sections 5.1.6, 5.13.3) — these appear as placeholders rather than specific controlled document numbers."
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "Some QMS references are placeholders (e.g., \"XX-XXX\", \"XX-YYY\") rather than specific controlled document numbers, making traceability to the QMS unclear for those items (Sections 1.4, 5.1.6, 5.13.3).",
    "No explicit visible signature/approval block, approver names, or approval signatures and dates are present in the provided excerpt demonstrating final approval and control metadata (the header shows Effective Date and Revision History but no approver signature lines).",
    "While Figure 1 is present and shows the high-level flow, the process flow graphic in the provided images does not include explicit mapping to document identifiers or owners for each step (e.g., which QMS process or role performs each element on the diagram).",
    "The provided excerpt does not include an explicit Quality Manual cross-reference entry (there are cross-references to QAPxxx procedures but not an explicit citation to the company Quality Manual document number)."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Replace placeholder references (e.g., \"XX-XXX\", \"XX-YYY\") with the actual controlled document numbers/names so that cross-references to Supplier Qualification, Management Responsibility, and any other QMS processes are unambiguous (update Sections 1.4, 5.1.6, 5.13.3 and any other locations where placeholders appear).",
    "Include visible document control metadata on the SOP (approval/signature block with approver name, title, signature/date, document owner, revision status) or provide the missing pages showing the approval evidence to demonstrate the procedure is controlled and approved per QAP001 (this will close the document-control evidence gap).",
    "On Figure 1 (Risk Management Overview), add annotations or a legend that maps each flow box to responsible roles and related QMS documents (e.g., 'Risk analysis — owner: Product Development; related doc: QAP012 Design Control; artifacts: Hazard Analysis, FMEA'). This will demonstrate integration with product realization and QMS processes more explicitly.",
    "Add an explicit reference (document number/section) to the Quality Manual or Quality Policy where the risk management process is described or integrated (if such an entry exists) to show formal QMS linkage.",
    "If available, provide the Risk Management Plan template, Risk Management File index and an example Risk Management Report from the QMS to show practical implementation and linkage to the SOP (these are expected artifacts)."
