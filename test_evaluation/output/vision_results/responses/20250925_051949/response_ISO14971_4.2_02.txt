  "rationale": "Overview: The submitted SOP QAP013.01 (Risk Management Program) documents a policy/process for establishing risk acceptability criteria and residual-risk evaluation. The document is an approved SOP (Effective Date 26Jun2024) and explicitly references regulatory/standards inputs (ISO 14971:2019, ISO/TR 24971:2020, 21CFR820.30, ISO 13485:2016). It requires that risk acceptance criteria and the method for evaluating overall residual risk be recorded in the Risk Management Plan and risk management file, includes quantitative/qualitative tables for probability, severity, and risk index (Tables 1-5) and defines required actions based on residual risk (Table 6). This satisfies several acceptance criteria: an approved policy exists (as an SOP), regulatory/standards inputs are cited, the policy requires accessibility via the risk management file and document control, and references to RMPs are present. However, one acceptance criterion is uncertain/partially satisfied: the requirement to \"define principles for specific device families where needed.\" The SOP requires that a Risk Management Plan be prepared for a particular combination product or product family and that criteria be specified in the RMP (Section 5.2.10 and 5.2.3.1), but the SOP itself does not contain concrete, device-family-specific acceptability principles or example thresholds — it delegates that definition to the RMP. Because the clause asks for a policy that defines and documents criteria for risk acceptability and \"defines principles for specific device families where needed,\" and the SOP only mandates that those principles be defined in the RMP (without giving examples or templates for device-family principles within the policy itself), this item is flagged as partially satisfied/uncertain. Summary against each acceptance criterion: 1) Approved policy exists — SATISFIED (SOP QAP013.01; Effective Date). 2) Cites regulatory/standard inputs — SATISFIED (References section and Purpose). 3) Defines principles for specific device families where needed — PARTIAL/UNCERTAIN (SOP requires RMP to define them but does not itself provide device-family principles or examples). 4) Accessible to teams — SATISFIED/PROVIDED (document control references and risk management file storage instructions). Given the partial/uncertain fulfilment of the device-family principles criterion, overall status is FLAGGED.",

    "Section 3. References: lists \"21CFR820.30\", \"ISO 14971: 2019\", \"ISO 12971: 2020\", \"ISO 62366: 2005\" — shows regulatory/standards cited.",
    "Roles — Functional Area Management (Responsibilities): \"Defines and documents criteria for risk acceptability in the Risk Management Procedure. This provides a framework that ensures that criteria are based upon applicable national or regional regulations and relevant International Standards and considers available information such as the general acknowledged state of the art and known stakeholder concerns.\"",
    "Section 5.2.3.1 (Risk Management Plan): \"The scope of the planned risk management activities, identifying and describing the combination product (or product family), intended use...\" — indicates RMP may cover product families.",

    "Section 5.2.5: \"Categories of risk and criteria for risk acceptability ... The risk acceptance criteria are based on the following decisions: 5.2.5.1. The risk presented by the current standard of care; 5.2.5.2. The potential health benefits ...; 5.2.5.3. The generally acknowledged state of the art defined in recognized consensus standards.\"",

  ],
  "gaps": [
    "The SOP delegates definition of device-family-specific risk acceptability principles to the Risk Management Plan but does not itself include example principles, templates, or explicit device-family thresholds — making it unclear whether device-family principles are consistently defined across RMPs.",
    "No explicit, visible approval signature block or document approval page excerpt was provided in the submitted text/images showing who approved the SOP (Top Management signature/approval stamp) — though an effective date is shown; explicit signed approval not shown.",
    "Reference list contains a likely typographical error: 'ISO 12971: 2020' (probably intended to be ISO/TR 24971:2020 is referenced elsewhere) — potential inconsistency in references.",
    "While the SOP states criteria must be recorded in the Risk Management Plan, the actual RMP(s) or Risk Acceptability Policy document(s) (if separate) were not provided to verify that per-product or per-family criteria were defined and accessible to teams.",
    "No concrete examples/templates within the SOP showing how device-family principles should be documented in the RMP (e.g., a sample matrix, or default thresholds for device families)."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Explicitly include device-family-level acceptability principles or a template in the SOP (or an Appendix) that RMP authors must populate. For example, include required fields: family name, justified residual-risk thresholds, examples of common hazards and target Risk Index ranges per family, and any deviations justified by benefit-risk analysis.",
    "Provide/attach one or more completed Risk Management Plans (RMPs) or a canonical Risk Acceptability Policy document as an artefact that demonstrates how device-family criteria have been defined and approved for typical product families. Reference these RMPs in the SOP or store them in the DMS with clear links.",
    "Add/verify an explicit SOP approval block (names, roles, signatures or electronic approval audit trail) and include a citation (page/section) in the SOP to show formal approval by Top Management.",
    "Correct and harmonize references (e.g., verify 'ISO 12971: 2020' vs ISO/TR 24971:2020) to avoid confusion. Ensure the References section lists all applicable regulations/standards consistently.",
    "Add a short guidance paragraph or example in Section 5.2 (Risk Management Plan) that prescribes minimum content for device-family principles (e.g., when a family-level RMP is allowed, mandatory stakeholder inputs, link to precedent RMPs), to reduce variability in RMP execution and to make the policy actionable and auditable.",
    "Ensure accessibility by adding a direct DMS path or document identifier in Section 5.3 (Risk Management File) and reference training records that show teams know where to find the policy and how to apply it (link to QAP011 training).",
    "When implementing the above, update the Risk Management Report template to require explicit citation to the SOP clause and the RMP section where device-family acceptability principles are recorded, so auditors can trace the policy to artifact(s)."
