  "status": "FLAGGED",
  "confidence": 0.78,
  "rationale": "I evaluated each acceptance criterion from ISO14971-4.2-02 against the supplied QAP013.01 (Risk Management Program) document. 1) Approved policy exists: the SOP (QAP013.01) is an issued controlled document with an Effective Date (26Jun2024) and Revision history, and the Procedure assigns responsibilities for approval and control of risk management documents (Sections 2 and 5.3.5). However, the provided text does not include an explicit approval signature block or an 'Approved by' entry showing top management/document owner approval of this SOP. Evidence is therefore partial (policy exists and is issued, but explicit documented approval is not visible in the supplied pages). 2) Cites regulatory/standard inputs: the SOP explicitly cites applicable regulations and standards (ISO 14971:2019, ISO/TR 24971:2020, ISO 13485:2016, 21CFR820.30, etc.) and repeatedly references use of state-of-the-art and stakeholder considerations — this acceptance criterion is satisfied. 3) Defines principles for specific device families where needed: the SOP requires the Risk Management Plan may be developed for a specific product or a family of similar products (Sections 5.2.3.1, 5.2.10) and directs top management to establish acceptable thresholds and to document scope and criteria in the RMP — this criterion is satisfied. 4) Accessible to teams: the SOP applies to all sites/functions (Section 1.2), requires the risk management file to be maintained in the document management system (Section 5.3.5) and references training and responsibilities (Sections 2, 5.1.8, QAP011). This criterion is satisfied. Because evidence for the first criterion (explicit documented approval of the policy/SOP) is incomplete in the supplied material, the overall status is FLAGGED (partial compliance) rather than PASS.",
  "evidence": [
    "Header / Document metadata: 'Document Number: QAP013.01 Title: RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM Effective Date: 26Jun2024' (document header supplied).",
    "Section 1.1 Purpose: '...in accordance with applicable subclauses of ISO 13485:2016, ISO 14971:2019, and taking into consideration the guidelines provided by ISO/TR 24971:2020.'",
    "Section 3 References: lists '21CFR820.30', 'ISO 14971: 2019', 'ISO 12971: 2020', 'ISO 62366: 2005' (References section).",
    "Section 2 Responsibilities (Functional Area Management): 'Defines and documents criteria for risk acceptability in the Risk Management Procedure. This provides a framework that ensures that criteria are based upon applicable national or regional regulations and relevant International Standards and considers available information such as the general acknowledged state of the art and known stakeholder concerns.'",
    "Section 5.2.3.1 (Risk Management Plan scope): '...identifying and describing the combination product (or product family), intended use, interfaces with external systems or processes, and the lifecycle phases for which each element of the plan is applicable.'",
    "Section 5.2.10: 'The risk management plan may be developed for a specific product or for a family of similar products, as appropriate.'",
    "Section 5.2.3.2.2: 'Top management of Product Development, Clinical Development, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance establish acceptable thresholds for residual risk acceptance within this procedure.'",
    "Section 5.3.5: 'The contents of the risk management file (documents, records, trace items, etc.) shall be controlled and maintained in the document management system in accordance with QAP001, Format, Content, Approval and Issuance of Controlled Documents.'",
    "Section 5.7 (Tables 1-5): includes explicit, documented risk acceptability-related criteria (P1/P2 tables, Severity Table 4, Risk Index Table 5) for estimating and categorizing probability, severity and risk index.",
    "Revision History: 'REV Change Summary A New Document' (shows this is a new controlled document), but no visible 'Approved by' signature or approval block in the supplied pages."
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "No explicit 'Approved by' signature block, approver name(s), or approval date is visible in the supplied pages — the document shows an Effective Date but lacks a visible signature/approval record.",
    "While the SOP mandates that top management establishes acceptable thresholds (5.2.3.2.2), the actual numeric/threshold values or a link to where those thresholds are recorded (e.g., a Risk Acceptability Policy appendix or RMP template with filled thresholds) is not present in the provided extract.",
    "No explicit pointer to the exact location (document ID or path) within the document management system where the master, approved SOP and Risk Management Plan templates are stored was provided in the supplied material.",
    "No explicit example or template of an RMP with documented acceptability criteria or a completed Risk Acceptability Policy document was included in the supplied pages."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add or include the document approval metadata (approver name(s), role(s), signature block or electronic approval stamp, and approval date) on QAP013.01 so the SOP clearly evidences formal approval by authorized management.",
    "If top management risk-acceptance thresholds are established in a separate Risk Acceptability Policy or within RMPs, include a clear cross-reference in QAP013.01 with document numbers/paths (e.g., 'See Risk Acceptability Policy QAP0XX or RMP template located at <DMS path>') so auditors and teams can readily locate the approved thresholds.",
    "Populate and retain, for each product or product family, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) that documents the specific acceptability criteria and thresholds (as required by Sections 5.2.3.1, 5.2.5 and 5.2.6) and ensure these RMPs are referenced in the Risk Management File as required by 5.3.4.",
    "Ensure the document management system (QAP001) entry for QAP013.01 includes revision-controlled attachments (e.g., approved RMP templates, Risk Acceptability Policy, and signatures) and provide the DMS path/ID in the SOP for easier team access.",
    "If not already practiced, include an appendix or example completed RMP that demonstrates how acceptability criteria (including thresholds and overall residual risk evaluation method) are documented for a product family to provide a concrete template for teams to follow."
