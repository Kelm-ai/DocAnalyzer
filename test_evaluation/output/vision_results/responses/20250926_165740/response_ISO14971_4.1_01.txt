  "rationale": "The document PD-002 (Risk Management Procedure for Combination Products) establishes, implements, documents, and maintains an ongoing risk management process across the product life cycle, including risk analysis, evaluation, control, and production/post-production activities, with explicit integration to product realization and QMS processes. It provides a process map/flow (Figure 1) and cross-references to related QMS processes and templates (e.g., PD-001, PD-002-T01, PD-002-T02, QA-018/QA-021/QA-024, QA-026).

    "Page 2, 1.0 Purpose: \"The purpose of this procedure is to establish, implement, document and maintain an ongoing process for risk management at Altimmune for combination products, including identifying hazards associated with a combination product, estimating and evaluating the associated risks, controlling these risks, and monitoring the effectiveness of the controls in accordance with applicable subclauses of ISO 13485:2016 [1], ISO 14971:2019, and taking into consideration the guidelines provided by ISO/TR 24971:2020.\"",
    "Page 2, 2.0 Scope: \"This procedure applies to the commercial and investigational (clinical) combination products designed, manufactured and distributed under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions throughout the product lifecycle phases, including product development, technology and design transfer, manufacturing, product surveillance and product discontinuation. This procedure applies to all sites and/or functions supporting and/or executing cGMP activities.\"",
    "Page 9-9, 8.1.4: \"The risk management process includes the following elements throughout the product life cycle. • Identifying hazards and hazardous situations associated with the combination product • Estimating and evaluating the associated risks • Controlling risk and monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures • Monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures • Risk reviews driven by new information • Periodic review of identified risks\"",

Top management of Product Development, Clinical Development, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance establish acceptable thresholds for residual risk acceptance within this procedure. When a product exceeds thresholds, but still has clinical benefit as designed, a benefit risk analysis is required to justify acceptance of risk.\"",

  "gaps": [
    "The artifact set mentions a Quality Manual explicitly; the text provides cross-references to QMS processes (QA-026, QA-018, QA-021, etc.) but does not show a standalone 'Quality Manual' document within the excerpt. This is mitigated by cross-references to QMS processes in References and 8.3.5."

  "recommendations": [
    "If required by the organization's audit policy, include an explicit cross-reference or appendix entry that maps this Risk Management Procedure to the Quality Manual and its sections, ensuring traceability from ISO14971 requirements to the QMS documentation.",
    "Provide a clearly labeled, standalone flowchart (process map) sourced from Figure 1 as a readily auditable document (e.g., a separate PDF or a diagram file) to satisfy the 'process map/flow shows required elements' criterion with auditable links to each element."
