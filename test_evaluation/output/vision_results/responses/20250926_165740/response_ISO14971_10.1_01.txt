  "confidence": 0.72,
  "rationale": "ISO14971-10.1-01 requires a system to actively collect and review safety-relevant information during production and post-production, with defined responsibilities and tools, and to list active/passive sources. The PD-002 Risk Management Procedure for Combination Products (SOP PD-002) includes a Post-Production/Production information collection process (8.12) that explicitly defines sources, responsibilities, and inputs to risk management (RM) artifacts, fulfilling the PMS system requirement. It also references templates and governance for RM planning and reporting, and periodic reviews. See evidence citations below mapped to acceptance criteria.",

    "8.12 Production and Post-Production Activities: Information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the product development and post-production phases to comply with Post Market Surveillance Regulations as well as to use the data to provide input to the Risk Management File for the device being marketed.

    "8.12.1 This information is collected in the Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process. (Page 28)",
    "8.12.2 Information generated by the user; Information generated by those accountable for the installation, use and maintenance of the combination product (as applicable); Information generated by the supply chain; Publicly available information; Information related to the generally acknowledged state of the art. (Page 28-29)",
    "8.12.3 The information collected shall be reviewed for possible relevance to safety, especially with respect to the following: Previously unrecognized hazards or hazard situations are present; An estimated risk arising from a hazardous situation is present; The generally acknowledged state of the art has changed. (Page 29)",
    "8.12.4 The results of this production and post-production evaluation(s) shall be recorded in the affected documents in the risk management file which include the Risk Management Plan, Hazards Analysis, FMEAs, and Risk Management Report. (Page 29)",

    "9.1 Periodic reviews of risk management documentation shall be conducted as a post market activity on an annual basis or as specified by the team and documented in the Risk Management Plan or when events that may impact the original risk management decision occur. (Page 29-30)",
    "8.3.1 For the combination product being considered, a risk management file shall be established and maintained throughout the product lifecycle. (Page 14)",
    "8.3.5 The contents of the risk management file (documents, records, trace items, etc.) shall be controlled and maintained in the document management system in accordance with QA-018, QA-021 and QA-024. (Page 15)",
    "8.3.6 The risk management file shall be maintained in the associated combination product design history file (DHF). (Page 15)",
    "8.11.1 Prior to release for clinical usage or commercial production of the combination product, the Applicant shall review the execution of the risk management plan. This review shall ensure the following, at a minimum: The risk management plan has been appropriately implemented; The risk management process has been appropriately implemented; The overall residual risk acceptability and overall benefit risk analysis have been determined; Appropriate methods to collect and review the information in the production and post-production phases have been determined and are in place.

  "gaps": [
    "Explicit standalone PMS Plan artifact is not named in the PD-002 document; PMS is addressed through Post-Market Surveillance/Complaint Handling processes and RM inputs, but a distinct PMS Plan document is not clearly defined within this SOP.",
    "Vigilance/field action procedures are not detailed as separate procedures within this SOP; references to Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling exist but explicit field action workflows are not enumerated here.",
    "Data pipelines or data integration architecture (e.g., specific data pipelines, IT systems, dashboards) are not described in detail; the document references inputs into RMF and post-production data sources but does not specify end-to-end data infrastructure.",
    "Some artifacts listed in the acceptance criteria (e.g., a stand-alone complaint handling SOP within this SOP) are referred to cross-document processes rather than defined within PD-002 itself."

  "recommendations": [
    "Consider adding an explicit PMS Plan section or cross-reference to a dedicated PMS Plan document, aligned with ISO14971/TR24971 guidance, to satisfy the artifact expectation.",
    "Incorporate or reference a dedicated Vigilance/Field Action SOP within the PMS framework, with clear triggers, decision flows, and responsibilities.",
    "Provide a schematic data pipeline diagram or appendix that maps data sources (active and passive) to RM processes and RMF inputs, including ownership, frequency, and data retention.",
    "Update the Evidence matrix to explicitly map each acceptance criterion to the corresponding PD-002 sections (with page/section anchors) to facilitate objective PASS/FAIL assessments in audits."
