  "rationale": "The PDF SOP PD-002 includes explicit sources for information collection (production, user, installation/maintenance, supply chain, publicly available information, state of the art) and mandates active collection/review in post-market phases, along with periodic reviews and literature/data review practices. It also covers competitor/similar products as sources for risk analysis. Artifacts are defined as RMF deliverables that can include supplier records, post-market data, and complaint handling inputs. These align with ISO14971-10.2-01 requirements for information collection from listed sources, periodic literature/signal review, and competitor/alternative monitoring. Evidence cited below.",
  "evidence": [
    "\"8.12.1 The information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the production and post-production phases to comply with Post Market Surveillance Regulations as well as to use the data to provide input to the Risk Management File for the device being marketed.\"",
    "\"8.12.2 Information generated during production and monitoring of the production process; Information generated by the user; Information generated by those accountable for the installation, use and maintenance of the combination product (as applicable); Information generated by the supply chain; Publicly available information; Information related to the generally acknowledged state of the art.\"",
    "\"8.6.3 The hazard identification methods may include the following. Ã˜ Review of the same or similar combination products (internally or externally), adverse event (AE) databases, publications and other sources.\"",
    "\"8.6.1 If a risk analysis, or other relevant information, is available for a similar combination product, that analysis or information may be used as a starting point for a new analysis.\"",
    "\"9.1 Periodic reviews of risk management documentation shall be conducted as a post market activity on an annual basis or as specified by the team and documented in the Risk Management Plan or when events that may impact the original risk management decision occur.\"",
    "\"8.9.5 A benefit-risk analysis shall be performed to determine the acceptability of each individual risk and the overall residual risk of the combination product. If a residual risk is deemed unacceptable using the criteria established in the risk management plan and further risk control is not practicable, the Applicant may gather and review data and literature to determine if the benefits outweigh this residual risk.\"",
    "\"8.3.4 The risk management file consists of the following deliverables, at a minimum: Hazards Analysis; Master Harms and Severity List; Risk Management Plan; Risk Analyses (internal and external); Benefit Risk Analysis (when applicable); Risk Management Report(s); Post-production Risk Management Report(s) (when appropriate); Any supporting or referenced documents or records of activities required by the risk management plan.\""

  "gaps": [
    "Explicit enumeration of 'service logs' and 'complaint database' as named artifacts within the Risk Management File is not explicitly listed, though post-market surveillance and complaint handling inputs are described.",
    "No explicit template or log format is shown for literature review logs or competitor/alternative therapy monitoring; references to logs are implicit within RMF deliverables."

  "recommendations": [
    "Add explicit references/templates for: (a) complaint database/logs within the Risk Management File; (b) service logs; (c) supplier quality records as standalone RMF artifacts; (d) literature review log templates; (e) a defined competitor/alternative therapy monitoring plan with sources (publications, AE databases, regulatory actions).",
    "Map each information source to corresponding RMF deliverables and assign owners responsible for ingestion and periodic review to strengthen traceability."
