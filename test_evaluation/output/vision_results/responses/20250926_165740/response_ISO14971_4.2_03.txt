These elements collectively demonstrate periodic reviews, action tracking via documented reviews, and updates to risk management artifacts as part of the process.",
  "evidence": [

  "gaps": [
    "No explicit Management Review Records or CAPA/Change Control tickets are included as attachments or exemplars in the provided document extract; the SOP references these artifacts (QA-026, CAPA/Change Control concepts) but does not provide concrete records.",
    "While the procedure references CAPA/Change Control and management review, there is no visible sample or cited instance of an actual CAPA ticket or management review record within the provided pages."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Attach or link actual Management Review Records (in QA-026 format) and CAPA/change control tickets to demonstrate evidence of periodic reviews and action tracking.",
    "Include a sample or template of the Management Review Record and CAPA form within the SOP or as an appendix to ensure auditable traceability of inputs, outputs, and actions.",
    "Add explicit cross-references to where periodic review outputs and corrective actions are stored (e.g., RM File, CAPA system, change control logs) to strengthen traceability."
