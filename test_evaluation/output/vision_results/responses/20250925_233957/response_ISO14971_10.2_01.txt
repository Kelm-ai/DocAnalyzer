  "rationale": "The SOP clearly defines routine collection of production and post-production information from the ISO 14971:2019 Clause 10.2 sources (production/process monitoring; user and maintenance/servicing; supply chain; publicly available information; state of the art). It also references use of similar products, AE databases and publications. However, explicit evidence of a periodic literature/signal review process and explicit competitor/alternative therapy monitoring cadence is not clearly stated in post-market surveillance terms within this document. The SOP relies on a separate Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process, which is not provided, and does not present concrete artifacts (supplier records, service logs, literature review logs) or a defined schedule for literature/signal review.",

  "gaps": [
    "No explicit, documented cadence or procedure for periodic literature review and signal detection in the post-market phase within this SOP (relies on an external PMS/Complaint Handling process not provided).",
    "Competitor/alternative therapy monitoring is implied (similar products, state of the art, publications) but not explicitly defined as a routine, scheduled activity in the post-market context.",
    "No concrete expected artifact examples provided (e.g., supplier quality records, service logs, complaint database extracts, literature review logs) within this document.",
    "Servicing feedback is addressed conditionally (\"as applicable\"), but procedures/artifacts such as service/maintenance logs are not specified.",
    "Supply chain input is listed as a source, but the mechanism, frequency, and artifacts (e.g., supplier quality performance summaries) are not detailed here."

  "recommendations": [
    "Augment Section 5.12 to explicitly require and define a periodic literature and signal detection review cadence (e.g., monthly/quarterly searches of AE databases, literature databases, and regulatory safety alerts) with roles, methods, and documentation requirements.",
    "Explicitly define competitor and alternative therapy monitoring within post-market surveillance (e.g., tracking similar devices/drug-device combinations and alternative therapies, with defined sources and frequency).",
    "Reference or incorporate the Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process details for literature/signal reviews, including example logs/templates, and ensure cross-references include document numbers.",
    "Specify servicing feedback mechanisms and artifacts (e.g., service/maintenance logs, field service reports) where applicable, or state criteria when not applicable.",
    "Define supply chain information ingestion methods and artifacts (e.g., supplier scorecards, SCARs, incoming quality trends) and their review frequency.",
    "Maintain and cite example artifacts in the Risk Management File index: complaint database outputs, PMS reports, literature review logs, supplier quality records, and service logs to evidence routine ingestion from all sources."
