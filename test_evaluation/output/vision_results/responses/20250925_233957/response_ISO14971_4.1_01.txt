  "rationale": "The SOP establishes, implements, documents, and maintains an ongoing ISO 14971–aligned risk management process across the full product lifecycle. It explicitly covers risk analysis, evaluation, control, residual risk evaluation, and production/post‑production activities, and shows integration with product realization (Design Control). A controlled procedure exists with document control, effective date, and revision history. A process flow/overview (Figure 1) shows the required elements. Cross‑references to related QMS processes are provided, though a few are placeholders.",

  "gaps": [
    "Some QMS cross‑references use placeholders (e.g., XX‑XXX Supplier Qualification and Management; XX‑YYY Management Responsibility) rather than specific controlled document numbers.",
