  "rationale": "The SOP defines how production and post-production information is reviewed for safety relevance and escalated back into the risk management process, including explicit triggers and requirements to update RM documents. However, required acceptance artifacts are not provided: no signal/safety review minutes, no evidence of actual updates to hazard analysis/RMP, and no CAPA records. The document references post-market surveillance and management review but does not supply the minutes or a dedicated signal management SOP. Therefore, not all acceptance criteria are satisfied.",
