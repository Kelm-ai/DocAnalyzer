  "rationale": "The SOP establishes an active system to collect and review safety-relevant information during production and post-production and integrates it into the Risk Management process. It lists multiple active and passive data sources and defines roles/responsibilities. However, it references, rather than provides, the actual Post Market Surveillance (PMS) and Complaint Handling procedures, and does not include or cite dedicated vigilance/field action procedures or specific tools/data pipelines. Acceptance criteria are partially met but key artifacts and tool/process specifics are missing.",
