  "rationale": "The submitted SOP (QAP013.01 RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, Effective 26Jun2024) establishes, implements, documents and maintains an ongoing risk management process for combination products and explicitly covers the full product life cycle. It contains dedicated sections for Risk Analysis (5.6), Risk Estimation (5.7), Risk Evaluation (5.8), Risk Control (5.9), Production & Post-production activities (5.12) and Periodic Reviews (5.13). The SOP is integrated with product realization (explicit reference to QAP012 Design Control) and mandates a Risk Management Plan and Risk Management File with required contents. The document references document control (QAP001) for maintaining the risk management file. A process flowchart (Figure 1 Risk Management Overview) is provided showing the required elements (risk analysis → risk evaluation → risk control → evaluation of overall residual risk → risk management review → production & post-production). Therefore the requirement ISO14971-4.1 (establish/implement/document/maintain an ongoing risk management process across lifecycle including analysis/evaluation/control and production & post-production, integrated with product realization) is met. Minor items identified below do not prevent conformance but should be addressed to improve clarity and traceability.",

    "Correct and clarify numeric probability ranges in Table 1 and Table 2 to remove inconsistent inequality directions and duplicate textual descriptions; ensure the numeric ranges are mutually exclusive and clearly documented in the Risk Management Plan or an attached numeric definitions table.",
