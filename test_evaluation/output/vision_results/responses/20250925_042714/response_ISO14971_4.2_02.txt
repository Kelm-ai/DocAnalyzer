  "rationale": "The QAP013.01 'RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM' SOP (effective 26Jun2024) functions as the organization's documented policy for establishing criteria for risk acceptability. It explicitly references ISO 14971:2019, ISO/TR 24971:2020 and 21 CFR 820.30; assigns responsibility to management to define and document criteria; requires the Risk Management Plan (RMP) to include categories and criteria for risk acceptability and to define the method/criteria for evaluation of overall residual risk; provides probability/severity/risk-index tables (Tables 1–5) and actions for residual risk (Table 6); and mandates top-management review/approval and document control so criteria are accessible to teams. These elements meet the core Clause 4.2 requirements. However, the SOP contains inconsistencies and lacks some explicit artifacts and templates (see gaps) that should be remedied to remove ambiguity and ensure consistent application across products/product families.",

  "gaps": [
    "Contradiction between Section 1.3 ('This SOP does not define the threshold for acceptable risk') and Section 5.2.3.2.2 / 5.2.6 which state that top management shall establish acceptable thresholds 'within this procedure' and that the RMP shall define criteria. The authoritative location for thresholds is ambiguous.",
    "No distinct, explicitly-named 'Risk Acceptability Policy' artifact shown in the excerpt — QAP013 is the RMP SOP and functions as the policy, but the acceptance criteria expectation ('Risk Acceptability Policy document') is not explicitly met with a separate policy document or a clearly labeled section.",
    "Although Tables 1–5 and Table 6 define probability/severity/risk-index and actions, there is no unambiguous statement that maps colors/actions to 'acceptable' vs 'unacceptable' (e.g., explicit rule: 'Green = acceptable; Yellow = acceptable only with actions/justification; Red = unacceptable unless approved after benefit-risk analysis'). The current wording implies actions but not a definitive acceptability decision boundary.",
    "No mandatory RMP template or example values for product-family-specific acceptability principles included. The SOP allows RMPs per product/family but does not provide a required template or examples to promote consistent application.",
    "Limited procedural detail on how 'known stakeholder concerns' are captured, reviewed and documented (no defined stakeholder list, consultation process or required evidence sources/frequency).",
    "No explicit evidence of top management signature/approval on the SOP excerpt (revision history shows 'A New Document' but no approval block visible in provided extract).",
    "Minor formatting/typographical issues in probability table ranges (e.g., Table 1 numeric ranges appear inconsistent in the excerpt) which could lead to interpretation errors.",
    "While the SOP instructs what should be in the RMP, it does not explicitly require RMPs to contain a machine-readable or clearly-located field where thresholds/acceptability criteria are recorded (risk of inconsistent placement across files)."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Clarify and reconcile the contradictory statements: decide whether the SOP will contain default acceptability thresholds or whether thresholds are set entirely in the RMP. Update Section 1.3 or 5.2.3.2.2 to state the authoritative location and process for threshold definition (e.g., 'Top management sets organization-level policy in this SOP; product/family-specific thresholds SHALL be recorded in the RMP with justification').",
    "Create or explicitly label a standalone 'Risk Acceptability Policy' (or add a clearly identified policy subsection in QAP013) that states high-level acceptability principles, approval authority and where product-specific thresholds must be recorded. Include top-management approval (name, role, signature/date) in the policy.",
    "Provide a mandatory RMP template (or annex) that includes required fields: product/family identifier; product-specific acceptability thresholds (numeric or categorical); rationale (benefit, state-of-the-art, standard-of-care); stakeholder concerns summary; references; date and approver signatures; and link to the SOP. Make completion of the template mandatory before design freeze or commercial release.",
    "Define explicit decision rules for risk-index categories: e.g., 'Green = acceptable; Yellow = not acceptable without documented mitigation or benefit-risk justification; Red = not acceptable unless benefit-risk analysis is approved by top management and residual risk is disclosed to users.' Record this mapping in the SOP/policy and the RMP template.",
    "Add a documented process and template for identifying, recording and reviewing stakeholder concerns (clinical, user, regulatory, payor) and the 'state of the art' assessment (sources, search frequency, owner) and require inclusion of the outputs in the RMP and Risk Management File.",
    "Correct typographical/formatting errors in probability tables (Table 1 ranges) to eliminate ambiguity; add a short example calculation (P = P1 * P2) and worked example mapping to the risk-index to ensure consistent use.",
    "Require visible evidence of top-management approval for the SOP and for each RMP's acceptability thresholds (approval block/signature and date) and store approval records in the document management system with direct links from the RMP.",
    "Mandate that each RMP explicitly reference QAP013 and include a specific, named section where thresholds and acceptability criteria are stored (to ensure consistent location and ease of team access).",
    "Communicate and train relevant teams on the policy and the RMP template so criteria and residual risk evaluation are applied consistently across product teams; include training records as part of the Risk Management File."
