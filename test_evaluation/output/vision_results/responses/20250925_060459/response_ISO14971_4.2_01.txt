  "confidence": 0.77,
  "rationale": "The SOP (QAP013.01) contains clear statements of topâ€‘management responsibilities, defined roles/responsibilities, and references to an organizational training program, which indicate commitment and assignment of competent personnel. (See Sections 2.1; Role Responsibility table; 5.2.3.2; 5.1.8; 5.11.1.6). However, the acceptance criteria explicitly require documented management commitment artifacts (e.g., management review minutes, resourcing decisions), training plans, and expected artifacts (management review records, org charts, resource plans). The provided document contains policy statements and references to other documents (e.g., QAP011, XX-YYY) but does not include the actual artifacts (management review minutes, explicit resourcing/approval records, org chart, or the training plan content). Because the evidence is partial (policy + references present, but the required documentary artifacts are missing from the supplied file), the status is FLAGGED rather than PASS or FAIL.",

  "gaps": [
    "No management review minutes or management review records included in the supplied document demonstrating that top management has actually reviewed/approved risk management outputs (the SOP references XX-YYY Management Review Process but no minutes are attached).",

    "Provide the training plan and records (QAP011 excerpt or training matrix, completed training/certification records for personnel involved in risk management) to show assignment of competent personnel and that required training was completed.",
    "Include copies of Risk Management Report approvals (signed/dated) or other top management approval artifacts referenced in Section 5.11.1.6, and any related benefit-risk analysis approvals, to close the evidence gap."
