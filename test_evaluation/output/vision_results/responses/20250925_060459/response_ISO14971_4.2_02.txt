  "rationale": "The supplied document QAP013.01 (RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM) constitutes a documented and effective policy for establishing criteria for risk acceptability aligned with regulations and standards, includes guidance on evaluation of overall residual risk, and provides for product- or product-family-specific risk management planning and accessibility to teams. Evidence: (1) The SOP explicitly states alignment to regulatory/standard inputs (ISO 14971:2019, ISO 13485:2016, ISO/TR 24971:2020 and 21 CFR) (Section 1.1; Section 3). (2) The document requires that criteria for risk acceptability be defined and documented in the Risk Management Plan and that Top Management establish acceptable thresholds for residual risk (Sections 2 Responsibilities / Functional Area Management; 5.2.3.2.2; 5.2.3.1; 5.2.5). (3) The SOP requires the method and criteria for acceptability for the overall residual risk be clearly defined and documented in the Risk Management Plan, and details how residual overall risk is to be evaluated (Sections 5.2.6; 5.10; 5.11). (4) The SOP allows RMPs to be developed for specific products or families and calls out that RMPs shall contain scope, responsibilities, and acceptance criteria (Sections 5.2.3.1; 5.2.10; 5.3.4). (5) Accessibility/maintenance of the policy and risk files is mandated via document control and the document management system (Section 5.3.5) and responsibilities for approval/oversight by QA and Top Management are defined (Section 2 and 5.11.1.6). Taken together, these items satisfy the Acceptance Criteria: an approved policy exists in the form of this SOP, regulatory/standard inputs are cited, principles and mechanisms exist to define device-family-specific acceptance criteria (via Risk Management Plan and Top Management thresholds), and the policy/documents are to be maintained in controlled document management systems and assigned to responsible functions (accessible to teams).",

    "The provided pages do not show an explicit SOP approval signature block or 'Approved by' signatory affixed to QAP013.01 (only an effective date and revision history are visible).",
    "The SOP delegates establishment of thresholds to Top Management and the Risk Management Plan but does not include concrete, example numeric acceptance thresholds for different device families within the SOP itself â€” device-family-specific acceptance criteria are implemented at the RMP level, not as example templates within this SOP.",
    "No explicit document management system path or direct instructions for how teams access the controlled SOP/RMPs (QAP001 is referenced but the access mechanism/link is not shown in the excerpt)."

  "recommendations": [
    "Add or include a visible approval/signature block (approver name, title, date, and signature) on the SOP to unambiguously demonstrate formal approval.",
    "Provide a template annex or example Risk Acceptability Thresholds (or a reference template) that RMPs should populate for common product families to make it easier and more consistent for teams to define device-family-specific acceptance criteria.",
    "Ensure the SOP or referenced QAP001 explicitly documents the document management system location and access instructions (e.g., document library path, access rights) so teams can readily retrieve the policy and associated RMPs.",
    "Require each Risk Management Plan (RMP) to explicitly reference QAP013.01 and to capture the device-family-specific acceptance criteria, the responsible approver, and the link to the controlled document in the DMS; consider adding a checklist to confirm RMPs include these items during review/approval."
