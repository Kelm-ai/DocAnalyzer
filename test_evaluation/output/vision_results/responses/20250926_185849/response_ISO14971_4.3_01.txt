It also assigns responsibility for risk management competence to QA and product development leadership. However, there is no visible training matrix, CVs/experience records, or explicit role-based competency profiles within the provided text. Evidence shows competence requirements exist and are to be addressed, but the specific artifacts required by ISO14971-4.3-01 (training matrix, CVs/experience, role-based competency profiles) are not present in the visible sections.",
