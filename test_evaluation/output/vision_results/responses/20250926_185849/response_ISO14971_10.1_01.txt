  "status": "FLAGGED",
  "confidence": 0.58,
  "rationale": "Evaluation against ISO14971-10.1 acceptance criteria shows partial fulfilment. The document defines a risk management system with post-production inputs and references to post-market surveillance activities, but it does not present a standalone PMS plan or explicit PMS procedures (e.g., a formal PMS Plan, complaint handling SOP, vigilance/field action procedures, or detailed data pipelines). Active and passive data sources are listed, and responsibilities/tools are defined to some extent. Therefore, criteria are not all clearly satisfied; evidence supports partial compliance and warrants FLAGGED.",
  "evidence": [
    "5.12 Production and Post-Production Activities: 5.12.1 Information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the production and post-production phases to comply with post market surveillance regulations as well as to use the data to provide input to the risk management file for the device being marketed. This information is collected in the Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process.",
    "5.12 Production and Post-Production Activities: 5.12.2 Information collected shall entail the following: 5.12.2.1 Information generated during production and monitoring of the production process; 5.12.2.2 Information generated by the user; 5.12.2.3 Information generated by those accountable for the installation, use and maintenance of the combination product (as applicable); 5.12.2.4 Information generated by the supply chain; 5.12.2.5 Publicly available information; 5.12.2.6 Information related to the generally acknowledged state of the art.",
    "2. Responsibilities: 2.1. Viking Therapeutics Product Development and Quality Assurance (QA) are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP. All functional leads/managers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the applicable segments of this procedure that are within their areas of responsibility.",
    "5.2. Risk Management Plan: 5.2.8 The risk management plan shall include method(s) for obtaining and reviewing relevant product-specific production and post-production information, including requirements for documentation of decisions, based on a risk analysis, with regard to post-market surveillance activities appropriate for the product. 5.2.8.1 At a minimum, data from the complaint handling process, if applicable, shall be used as part of the residual risk analysis.",
    "5.3. Risk Management File: 5.3.1 For the combination product being considered, a risk management file shall be established and maintained throughout the product lifecycle. 5.3.4 The risk management file consists of deliverables including Hazard Analysis, Risk Management Plan, Risk Analyses, Risk Management Report(s), and Post-production Risk Management Report(s) (when appropriate).",
    "5.11 Risk Management Report: 5.11.1 Prior to release for clinical usage or commercial production of the combination product, the applicant shall review the execution of the risk management plan and confirm that appropriate methods to collect and review information in production and post-production phases have been determined and are in place."

  "gaps": [
    "No standalone PMS Plan document is provided (only references to post-market surveillance concepts).",
    "No explicit Complaint Handling SOP is included in the text; only a reference to Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process.",
    "No explicit Vigilance/Field Action Procedures are described.",
    "No detailed data pipelines or data architecture (ingest, processing, analysis, dashboards) are specified.",
    "Roles for PMS-specific activities (e.g., PMS owner, data stewards, escalation paths) are not clearly delineated beyond general risk management responsibilities."

  "recommendations": [
    "Develop and attach a formal PMS Plan aligned with ISO 14971/TR 24971, detailing scope, data sources (active and passive), data flow, metrics, responsibilities, and escalation.",
    "Create and implement a Complaint Handling SOP explicitly describing intake, triage, timelines, owner, and closure.",
    "Define Vigilance/Field Action Procedures with triggers, responsibilities, and communication steps.",
    "Document data pipelines and analytics infrastructure for post-market data (data sources, ingestion, processing, retention, privacy/compliance considerations, and reporting), including dashboards for management review.",
    "Map PMS activities to the Risk Management File and ensure periodic integration with management reviews and post-market surveillance reporting."
