  "rationale": "The ISO14971-10.2-01 information collection requirements are addressed in the Risk Management Program SOP. The document specifies routine collection and review of information from listed sources (production/post-production, user, installation/maintenance, supply chain, publicly available information, and state of the art) and requires periodic reviews and post-market surveillance input, including review of similar products and external sources for hazard identification and risk assessment. This aligns with acceptance criteria for routine ingestion, literature/signal review, and competitor/alternative product monitoring.",
  "evidence": [
    "5.12.1.Information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the production and post-production phases to comply with post market surveillance regulations as well as to use the data to provide input to the risk management file for the device being marketed.",
    "5.12.2.Information collected and reviewed about the combination product shall entail the following considerations, at a minimum: 5.12.2.1. Information generated during production and monitoring of the production process 5.12.2.2. Information generated by the user 5.12.2.3. Information generated by those accountable for the installation, use and maintenance of the combination product (as applicable) 5.12.2.4. Information generated by the supply chain 5.12.2.5. Publicly available information 5.12.2.6. Information related to the generally acknowledged state of the art.",
    "5.12.3.The information collected shall be reviewed for possible relevance to safety, especially with respect to the following: 5.12.3.1. Previously unrecognized hazards or hazardous situations are present 5.12.3.2. An estimated risk arising from a hazardous situation is present 5.12.3.3. The overall residual risk is no longer acceptable in relation to the benefits of the intended use 5.12.3.4. The generally acknowledged state of the art has changed",
    "5.13.1.Periodic reviews of risk management documentation shall be conducted as a post market activity on an annual basis or as specified by the team and documented in the risk management plan or when events that may impact the original risk management decision occur.",
    "5.6.3.3.1. For hazard identification, Review of the same or similar combination products (internally or externally), adverse event (AE) databases, publications, and other sources."

  "gaps": [
    "Explicitly stated 'literature review logs' or a named 'competitor monitoring program' is not verbatim present; however, literature/public sources and review of similar products are described."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider adding explicit requirements for maintaining literature review logs and a formal competitor/alternative therapy monitoring program (with defined frequency, owners, and documentation templates) to strengthen traceability and alignment with ISO14971-10.2-01.",
    "Link periodic literature/signal review and competitor monitoring to the Risk Management File and Risk Management Report with defined ownership and review intervals in a dedicated appendix."
