It contains dedicated sections for Risk Analysis (5.6), Risk Estimation (5.7), Risk Evaluation (5.8), Risk Control (5.9), Production & Post-production activities (5.12) and Periodic Reviews (5.13). The SOP is integrated with product realization (explicit reference to QAP012 Design Control) and mandates a Risk Management Plan and Risk Management File with required contents. The document references document control (QAP001) for maintaining the risk management file.
