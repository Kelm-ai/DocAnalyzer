5.1.1. Risk management is a process to identify, assess and control risks that affect the quality

or safety of a combination product. The risk management process is intended to identify

and manage quality risks or hazards that can potentially lead to patient or user harm.

Outputs from this process may be inputs to other quality processes.

5.1.2. Risk management is integrated within QAP012 , Design Control as part of product

realization. The Risk Management File and related activities shall be reviewed when design changes are implemented to assure any new risks or changes to existing risks are

identified and evaluated.

5.1.3. Elements of this procedure may be used for combination products in early clinical

development to ensure risks to user/patient safety have been evaluated.

5.1.4. The risk management process includes the following elements throughout the product life

cycle:

5.1.4.1. Identifying hazards and hazardous situations associated with the combination

product

5.1.4.2. Estimating and evaluating the associated risks

5.1.4.3. Controlling risk and monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures

5.1.4.4. Monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures

5.1.4.5. Risk reviews driven by new information

5.1.4.6. Periodic review of identified risks

5.1.5. Figure 1 illustrates the systemic representation of the risk management process.

Depending on the specific product lifecycle phase, individual elements of risk

management can have varying emphasis, but always governed by a risk management

plan (RMP). In addition, risk management activities can be performed iteratively or in

multiple steps as appropriate to the combination product.

5.1.6. As a check on the effectiveness of the risk management processes defined, management

shall regularly review the outputs of processes, products, services, and the quality system,

and make improvements as needed, in accordance with the Management Review Proc ess

specified in XX- YYY, Management Responsibility.

5.1.7. Documented records, including evidence of decisions and actions taken, shall be

maintained to ensure and demonstrate the effective planning, operation, and control of this

5.6. Risk Analysis

5.6.1. Risk Analysis Process

5.6.1.1. The purpose of the risk analysis is as follows.

5.6.1.1.1. Identify all reasonably foreseeable and/or known hazards, hazardous

situations, causes, foreseeable sequences of events and associated harms

(reference ISO/TR 24971:2020 Annex A for examples)

5.6.1.1.2. Estimate the probability of the occurrence and severity of the harms in order to estimate risk

5.6.1.1.3. Identify the risk controls necessary to mitigate and control risk

5.6.1.1.4. Estimate the reduction or elimination of the probability of occurrence due to the implementation of the risk controls.

5.6.1.2. The risk analysis shall take into consideration the intended use, the user(s) and the

use environment for the combination product.

5.6.1.3. If a risk analysis, or other relevant information, is available for a similar combination

product, that analysis or information may be used as a starting point for a new

analysis. The degree of relevance depends on the differences between the devices and whether these introduce new hazards or significant differences in outputs,

characteristics, performance, or results. The extent of use of an existing analysis is

also based on the systematic evaluation of the effects the changes have on the

development of hazardous situations.

5.6.1.4. At a minimum, a usability risk analysis and a system risk analysis are required. The risk management plan may specify additional risk analysis ( e.g., process) as

appropriate.

5.6.1.4.1. The usability risk analysis is used to analyze the risk of the use of the combination product.

5.6.1.4.2. The system risk analysis is used to analyze the risk of the design and/or

## Page 12

manufacture of the combination product (as specified in the scope of the risk

management plan).

5.6.1.4.3. The usability and system risk analyses utilize the same basic structure and

methods of risk estimation.

5.6.1.5. Risk analyses shall be conducted with the support of a team composed of subject

matter experts with expertise on the subject being analyzed. Expertise provided by

each team member shall be documented.

5.6.1.6. Severity, likelihood and (optionally) detection ratings shall be defined in applicable risk management work instructions or procedures based on the scope of the risk

analysis (i.e., usability, system, process). Use of alternate definitions from those established in the associated procedures may be acceptable with proper justification

and approval from Quality Assurance. Any alternative definitions shall be

documented in the Risk Management Plan.

5.6.2. Intended Use, Reasonably Foreseeable Misuse, and Identification of Characteristics Related to the Safety of the Combination Product

in a hazardous situation (exposure to a hazard). The risk analysis shall identify and

document sequences of events or cause(s) for each hazard that could result in a

hazar dous situation. Sequences of events are documented in the Hazards Analysis

and the FMEAs.

5.6.6.2. Reasonably Foreseeable sequence of events or cause(s) may include the following:

5.6.6.2.1. Faults during use (documented in the Usability Risk Analysis), use faults

related to misuse, and intentional misuse shall be considered.

5.6.6.2.2. Faults in design (or manufacturing as applicable) or interactions with external

systems and processes (documented in the System Risk Analysis)

5.6.6.2.3. Hazardous situations may result from no- fault conditions (documented in the

System Risk Analysis)

NOTE : Sequences of events or cause(s) that relate to both usability and

design may be documented in either the usability or system risk analysis,

depending on the primary cause(s) of the hazard (Use or System).

5.7. Risk Estimation

5.7.1. Reasonably foreseeable sequences or combinations of events that can result in a

hazardous situation shall be considered and the resulting hazardous situation(s) shall be recorded in the hazards analysis and the FMEAs.

5.7.2. For each identified hazardous situation, the associated risk(s) shall be estimated using available information or data. For hazardous situations for which the probability of the occurrence of harm cannot be estimated, the possible consequences shall be li sted for

## Page 14

use in risk evaluation and risk control. The results of these activities shall be recorded in

hazards analysis and the FMEAs.

5.7.3. Risk estimation may be quantitative or qualitative. Information or data for estimating risks

may be obtained from the following sources:

5.7.3.1. Published standards

5.7.3.2. Scientific or technical investigations

5.7.3.3. Field data from similar combination products already in use, including publicly

available reports of incidents

5.7.3.4. Usability tests employing typical users

5.7.3.5. Clinical evidence

5.7.3.6. Results of relevant investigations or simulations

5.7.3.7. Expert opinion

5.7.3.8. External quality assessment schemes

5.7.4. Risk has two (2) components, which are the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of harm. To estimate risk, the occurrence and severity shall first be estimated.

5.7.4.1. Occurrence is estimated by first estimating two (2) probabilities referred to as P

1 and

### P2.

5.7.4.1.1. P1 is the probability that the hazardous situation will occur.

5.7.4.1.2. P2 is the probability that the hazardous situation will result in harm.

5.7.4.1.3. The overall occurrence is P = P 1 x P 2.

5.7.4.2. Methods for estimating occurrence may include the following:

5.7.4.2.1. Review of the same or similar combination products (internally or externally),

adverse event (AE) databases, publications, and other sources. (Similar

combination products may include shared subsystems, software code or

intended use(s).)

5.7.4.2.2. Use of fault tree analysis (FTA) to decompose the probability estimation

5.7.4.2.3. Use of bench data (laboratory) or simulations

5.7.4.2.4. Use of data from clinical trials

5.7.4.2.5. Use of expert judgement

5.7.4.3. Whenever possible, the probability of occurrence of harm should be estimated.

When the probability of occurrence of harm cannot be estimated, the risk

acceptance criteria should be developed based on the following:

5.7.4.3.1. If it is not possible to estimate P 1, assume that the P 1 probability is equal to 1.

If it is not possible to estimate P 2, assume that the P 2 probability is equal to 1.

If these assumptions result in an unacceptable risk, conduct a benefit risk

analysis to determine if the potential risk is acceptable based on the potential

benefit of the combination product.

5.7.4.4. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Risk Management Plan, the probability of the

hazardous situation occurring (P 1) shall be interpreted from Table 1.
