The SOP: (1) explicitly assigns responsibility to Top Management and Functional Area Management to define and document criteria for risk acceptability (Page 4); (2) requires that risk acceptance criteria be defined in the Risk Management Plan and that the method for evaluating overall residual risk be documented (Sections 5.2.3.1, 5.2.3.2.2, 5.2.5, 5.2.6); (3) cites applicable regulations and standards in the References section (ISO 14971:2019, ISO/TR 24971:2020, ISO 62366, 21CFR820.30) and states the use of state of the art and stakeholder concerns as inputs to criteria (Page 3 Purpose; Page 4 Functional Area Management responsibilities; Page 9 section 5.2.5); (4) provides for device/family-specific guidance by requiring the Risk Management Plan to specify scope by product or product family and to document criteria applicable to that scope (5.2.3.1; 5.2.10); and (5) makes the policy and the criteria accessible and controlled through the risk management file and the document management system (5.3.4\u20135.3.6). The SOP also prescribes how overall residual risk is to be evaluated and disclosed (Sections 5.9.4, 5.10, and 5.11). Together these elements satisfy the acceptance criteria: an approved, documented policy exists (the SOP and its required RMPs/RMFs), it cites regulatory/standards inputs and state-of-the-art/stakeholder considerations, it provides for product-family specific criteria, and it ensures accessibility to teams via controlled documents and files.",
