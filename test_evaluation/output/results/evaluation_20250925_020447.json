However, no management review minutes or explicit resourcing decision records are provided in the supplied document, only references to other procedures (e.g., XX-YYY Management Responsibility).\n\n- Defined roles: The SOP contains explicit role and responsibility definitions for Top Management, Functional Area Management, Clinical Development, Quality Assurance Management, QA, and Regulatory Affairs (satisfies the 'defined roles' criterion).\n\n- Training plans / competent personnel: The SOP requires competent personnel and references a training program (QAP011) as the source of competence/training requirements, but the actual training plan(s), training records, or evidence of assignment/qualification of specific personnel are not included in the supplied content.\n\nBecause the acceptance criteria require documentary artifacts (management review records, org charts, resource plans, training plans/records) and these artifacts are not present in the provided material, the result is FLAGGED (partial/uncertain).",
