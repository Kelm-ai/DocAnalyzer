      "rationale": "Evaluation of each acceptance criterion:\n\n1) Procedure(s) exist and are controlled \u2014 SATISFIED: The Risk Management SOP is present (QAP013.01) with document header, effective date and revision history (Page 1; Page 7 Appendix indicates new document). Document control linkage is stated: the risk management file contents shall be controlled in the document management system in accordance with QAP001 (Page 10: Section 5.3.5). Specific citations: Page 1: Document Number QAP013.01 and title; Page 10 (5.3.5): \"The contents of the risk management file... shall be controlled and maintained in the document management system in accordance with QAP001, Format, Content, Approval and Issuance of Controlled Documents.\"\n\n2) Scope includes life-cycle coverage \u2014 SATISFIED: The SOP explicitly applies across product lifecycle phases and lists lifecycle elements. The scope statement and lifecycle elements are documented (Page 3: Section 1.2 scope; Page 7: Section 5.1.4 lists lifecycle elements such as identifying hazards, estimating/evaluating risks, controlling risks, monitoring effectiveness, and periodic reviews). Specific citations: Page 3 (1.2) \"...throughout the product lifecycle phases, including product development, technology and design transfer, manufacturing, product surveillance and product discontinuation.\" Page 7 (5.1.4) lists the risk management process elements throughout the product life cycle.\n\n3) Process map/flow shows required elements \u2014 NOT FULLY SATISFIED / UNCERTAIN: The SOP references a process overview graphic: \"Figure 1 illustrates the systemic representation of the risk management process\" (Page 7). However, the actual process map/flow (Figure 1) content is not present in the provided text, so I cannot confirm that the figure explicitly shows the required elements (risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, production & post-production activities) in diagram form. The textual procedure does enumerate these elements (5.1.4 and throughout Sections 5.6\u20135.12), but the acceptance criterion asked specifically for a process map/flow showing required elements. Evidence of the figure's existence is present (Page 7), but the figure itself is not available in the provided excerpt to verify its content.\n\n4) References to related QMS processes are clear \u2014 SATISFIED: The SOP cross-references multiple QMS processes and procedures (Design Control QAP012, Document control QAP001, GMP Training QAP011, Management Responsibility XX-YYY, Supplier Qualification XX-XXX) and cites applicable standards (ISO 14971:2019 etc.). Specific citations: Page 3 (1.1) references ISO 14971:2019 and ISO/TR 24971:2020; Page 7 (5.1.2) \"Risk management is integrated within QAP012, Design Control\"; Page 10 (5.3.5) references QAP001; Page 8 (5.1.8) references QAP011; management review cross-reference to XX-YYY appears on Page 7 and Page 19 (5.1.6, 5.13.3).\n\nSummary conclusion: The SOP exists, is linked to document control, covers lifecycle elements in text, and includes clear QMS cross-references. However, the acceptance criterion requiring a process map/flow that shows the required elements cannot be fully verified because the referenced Figure 1 is not included in the provided excerpt. Because of this uncertainty, the overall determination is FLAGGED rather than PASS.",

      "rationale": "Assessment against each acceptance criterion:\n\n1) Documented management commitment (e.g., management review minutes, resourcing decisions): PARTIAL/UNSATISFIED. The SOP contains explicit statements of management responsibility and commitment (e.g., \"Assures adequate resources and support to carry out this process\" and \"Ensures provision of adequate resources and assignment of competent personnel for risk management\") which demonstrate management commitment in policy (Page 4). The SOP also requires management review per the Management Review Process (Page 8: \"management shall regularly review the outputs... in accordance with the Management Review Process specified in XX-YYY\") and references that risk management shall be reviewed as part of management review (Page 20: 5.13.3). However, the acceptance criterion requests documented evidence such as management review minutes or resourcing decisions. Those specific artifacts are not present in the provided document (no management review minutes, no resource allocation records or signed resourcing decisions are included). Therefore documented commitment is only evidenced at the procedural/policy level, not by the concrete artifacts specified in the acceptance criteria.\n\n2) Defined roles: SATISFIED. The document defines roles and responsibilities for Top Management, Clinical Development, Quality Assurance Management, Quality Assurance, Regulatory Affairs and others. Examples include: \"Assures adequate resources and support...\", \"Overall responsibility for effective execution and oversight of risk management process...\", and responsibilities listed under Quality Assurance and Management (Pages 4-5). These constitute defined roles and responsibilities for the risk management process.\n\n3) Training plans / assignment of competent personnel: PARTIAL/UNSATISFIED. The SOP requires competent personnel and references training requirements and programs (Page 8: \"Persons performing risk management tasks have the knowledge and experience appropriate... Appropriate competence and training program requirements are described in QAP011, GMP Training Program.\") and Page 5 (Quality Assurance: \"Completes all required training and qualification activities prior to conducting formal risk analysis\"). However, the acceptance criterion expects training plans or evidence thereof. The SOP references QAP011 but does not include the actual training plan, training matrix, or records demonstrating assignment/qualification of competent personnel in the risk management file. Therefore the requirement for documented training plans/records is not fulfilled in the provided artifact.\n\nConclusion: While the SOP demonstrates top management commitment at the policy/procedural level and provides clearly defined roles, it lacks the specific documented artifacts (management review minutes, formal resourcing decisions, resource plans, org chart, or training plan/records) requested in the acceptance criteria. Accordingly the result is FLAGGED rather than PASS.",

      "rationale": "I evaluated each acceptance criterion individually against the provided Risk Management Program (QAP013.01) document and evidence found therein.\n\n1) Approved policy exists: FLAGGED \u2014 The SOP QAP013.01 (Risk Management Program) is an established controlled document (Document Number QAP013.01; Effective Date 26Jun2024) and functions as the organization's risk management policy/procedure. However, there is no explicit approval signature block or statement in the excerpt showing that a Top Management approval or formal sign-off for this policy document itself is recorded in the provided pages. Because the acceptance criterion requires an 'approved policy exists' and explicit approval evidence is not shown in the provided context, this criterion is uncertain and thus flagged. (See evidence: Page 1 header; Page 9: 5.2.3.2.2 referencing top management responsibilities; but no explicit approval signature shown.)\n\n2) Cites regulatory/standard inputs: PASS \u2014 The SOP explicitly lists and references applicable regulations and standards (ISO 14971:2019, ISO 13485:2016, ISO/TR 24971:2020, 21 CFR 820.30, etc.) in the References and Purpose sections. The document repeatedly aligns processes and criteria to ISO 14971 and related guidance. (See evidence: Page 3 Purpose and Page 5 References.)\n\n3) Defines principles for specific device families where needed: PASS (with design-to-plan approach) \u2014 The SOP requires that the Risk Management Plan (RMP) define scope and criteria and allows RMPs to be developed for a specific product or a family of similar products. It also provides the principles to be used when determining acceptability (e.g., based on standard of care, benefit, state of the art) and includes tables and a Risk Index method. Therefore the document defines principles and instructs tailoring to device/product families via the RMP. (See evidence: Page 9 5.2.3.1, 5.2.10, Page 9 5.2.5 and Pages 14-16 with Tables 1-5 and Table 6.)\n\n4) Accessible to teams: PASS \u2014 The SOP states applicability to all sites/functions, requires the risk management file and plan to be controlled and maintained in the document management system (QAP001), and assigns responsibilities to Product Development and QA for ensuring compliance. These demonstrate intended accessibility to relevant teams. (See evidence: Page 3 Scope and Page 10 5.3.5 and Page 4-5 roles/responsibilities.)\n\nSummary: Although the SOP contains the required regulatory references, principles for acceptability, and mechanisms to tailor criteria for product families and to make them available to teams, there is insufficient explicit evidence in the provided excerpt of formal approval/signature (approval record) of the policy document itself or a distinct 'Risk Acceptability Policy' artifact. Per the mandatory method, any doubt requires downgrading; therefore overall status is FLAGGED.",
