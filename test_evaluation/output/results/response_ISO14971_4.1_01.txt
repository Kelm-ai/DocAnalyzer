  "status": "PASS",

  "rationale": "Acceptance criterion 1 (Procedure(s) exist and are controlled): Satisfied. A dedicated SOP (QAP013.01) is issued with an effective date and revision history, and it mandates document control via QAP001. Evidence shows control of the risk management file and documents. Acceptance criterion 2 (Scope includes life‑cycle coverage): Satisfied. The SOP explicitly applies across all lifecycle phases and includes post‑production and periodic reviews. Acceptance criterion 3 (Process map/flow shows required elements): Satisfied. The SOP references a Figure showing the process overview and textually maps all ISO 14971 elements (risk analysis, evaluation, control, and production/post‑production) with dedicated sections. Acceptance criterion 4 (References to related QMS processes are clear): Satisfied. Clear cross‑references exist to Design Control (QAP012), Document Control (QAP001), Training (QAP011), Management Review, Supplier Qualification, and PMS/Complaints, demonstrating integration with product realization and broader QMS. Minor editorial issues (placeholder doc numbers, a typographical reference) do not prevent meeting Clause 4.1.",
