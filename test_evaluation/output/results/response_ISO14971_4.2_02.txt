  "status": "PASS",
  "confidence": 0.84,
  "rationale": "Each acceptance criterion is satisfied: (1) Approved policy exists: The controlled SOP QAP013.01 (Effective Date 26Jun2024) defines and governs the risk acceptability framework, with roles for establishing criteria and management approval, indicating an approved, controlled policy document. (2) Cites regulatory/standard inputs: The SOP explicitly aligns with ISO 14971:2019, ISO/TR 24971:2020, ISO 13485:2016, and 21 CFR 820.30, and directs that acceptability criteria be based on regulations, relevant standards, state of the art, and stakeholder concerns. (3) Defines principles for specific device families: The SOP requires that risk acceptance criteria be defined in the Risk Management Plan for each product or product family and that those criteria be based on standard of care, health benefit, and state of the art. (4) Accessible to teams: Responsibilities assign compliance across functions; the SOP and risk files are controlled in the document management system and maintained in the DHF, ensuring access. (5) Includes guidance on overall residual risk: The SOP requires defining method and criteria for acceptability of the overall residual risk in the RMP and mandates evaluation and documentation of overall residual risk in the Risk Management Report. While there is a minor wording inconsistency about where criteria are documented (Procedure vs Plan), the core requirements of ISO 14971 clause 4.2 are met.",

  "gaps": [
    "Minor inconsistency: Page 4 says management defines criteria for risk acceptability \"in the Risk Management Procedure,\" while Page 5 assigns QA to define criteria \"in the Risk Management Plan.\" The intent is clear (criteria in RMPs) but wording could be harmonized.",

  "recommendations": [
    "Harmonize language to consistently state that risk acceptability criteria are defined in the Risk Management Plan for each product/family, and remove or correct the reference to \"Risk Management Procedure\" in the role description.",
    "Correct the reference list to explicitly cite ISO/TR 24971:2020 (replace \"Iso 12971 : 2020\").",
    "Ensure the controlled copy of QAP013.01 shows approval metadata per QAP001 (owners/approvers and approval dates).",
    "Verify that RMP templates include a dedicated section to define risk acceptance criteria and the method/criteria for overall residual risk, referencing standard of care, expected benefits, and state of the art.",
    "Optionally, issue a concise, top-management-endorsed Risk Acceptability Policy summary that points to QAP013.01 and clarifies the organizational principles and approval requirements; this can further strengthen evidence for ISO 14971 clause 4.2."
