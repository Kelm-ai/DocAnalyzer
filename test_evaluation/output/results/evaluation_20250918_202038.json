It also references integration with product realization (Design Control) and other QMS procedures. However, a process map/flow (Figure 1) is referenced but not present in the provided document, and document control/approval metadata are blank or templated. These omissions leave one acceptance criterion (presence of a process map/flow and clear evidence the procedure itself is a controlled document) incompletely evidenced in the supplied content.",

However, the document does not include or attach the documented artifacts required by the acceptance criteria (management review minutes, resourcing decisions, org charts, or concrete training plans/training records).

      "rationale": "The procedure contains high-level policy elements relevant to establishing risk acceptability criteria: it cites ISO standards, assigns responsibility to top management to establish thresholds, and specifies principles to be used when defining criteria (standard of care, benefit, state of the art). However it explicitly states that it does not define thresholds and delegates device/family-specific criteria and the method for overall residual risk acceptability to the Risk Management Plan. There is no clear evidence of a distinct, approved 'Risk Acceptability Policy' document (or an approval block within this procedure) that formally defines and documents the policy for establishing risk acceptability criteria, cites regulatory inputs, and is made directly accessible to teams. Therefore the requirement is partially met but incomplete and needs follow-up/confirmation.",
