      "rationale": "The provided document (QAP013.01 Risk Management Program) is a formal SOP that establishes, implements, documents and maintains an ongoing risk management process for combination products. It explicitly references ISO 14971:2019 and ISO/TR 24971:2020, defines scope across product lifecycle phases (development, transfer, manufacturing, surveillance, discontinuation), and contains sections covering risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, and production & post-production activities. The SOP references integration with product realization (QAP012 Design Control), document control (QAP001), and other QMS processes. It also requires a Risk Management Plan, Risk Management File, Hazard Analysis, risk analysis methods, verification/validation of controls, post-production monitoring, and periodic reviews, which collectively satisfy the clause 4.1 requirement to cover the entire device lifecycle and required elements.",

        "1.1. The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish, implement, document and maintain an ongoing process for risk management at Viking Therapeutics for combination products ... in accordance with applicable subclauses of ISO 13485:2016, ISO 14971:2019, and taking into consideration the guidelines provided by ISO/TR 24971:2020.",
        "1.2. This SOP applies to the commercial and investigational (clinical) combination products ... throughout the product lifecycle phases, including product development, technology and design transfer, manufacturing, product surveillance and product discontinuation.",
        "5.1.4. The risk management process includes the following elements throughout the product life cycle: 5.1.4.1. Identifying hazards and hazardous situations ... 5.1.4.2. Estimating and evaluating the associated risks 5.1.4.3. Controlling risk and monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures 5.1.4.4. Monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures 5.1.4.5. Risk reviews driven by new information 5.1.4.6. Periodic review of identified risks",

However, the document itself does not contain or cite concrete, verifiable artifacts demonstrating management commitment (e.g., management review minutes, documented resourcing decisions, org charts with named assignments, or training plans/completion records).
