  "rationale": "Acceptance criterion 1 (Documented management commitment) is not satisfied. The SOP establishes top-management responsibilities and references management reviews, but provides no objective records (e.g., management review minutes, resourcing decisions) demonstrating commitment in practice. Acceptance criterion 2 (Defined roles) is satisfied; roles and responsibilities for top management and functions are clearly defined. Acceptance criterion 3 (Training plans) is satisfied at the procedural level via explicit training/competence requirements and reference to the GMP Training Program. Because not all acceptance criteria are met, overall status is FAIL.",
