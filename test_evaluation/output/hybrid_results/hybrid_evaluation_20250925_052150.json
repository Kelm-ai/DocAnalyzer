Evidence of a process flowchart (Figure 1) and cross-references to QMS documents (QAP012 Design Control, QAP001 Document Control, QAP011 Training Program, Post Market Surveillance / Complaint Handling) are present. However, some cross\u2011references use placeholders (e.g., \"XX-XXX\", \"XX-YYY\") and the SOP explicitly states it does not define specific thresholds for acceptable risk (section 1.3), deferring those to top management / the Risk Management Plan. Because of these incomplete references and the lack of clearly documented numeric/definitive risk acceptability criteria within the SOP itself, the acceptance criteria are only partially satisfied and require closure actions.",

Key elements required by ISO 14971 Clause 4.2 are present in principle: responsibility for defining criteria is assigned to Top Management/QA, the basis for criteria (standard of care, benefit, state of the art) is stated, and the RMP/Risk Management File is required to contain the criteria and be controlled. However the artefact-level acceptance criteria require an approved, explicit Risk Acceptability Policy (or documented thresholds) and device-family principles; the SOP explicitly states it does not define thresholds and defers threshold definition to the RMP. There is no explicit evidence in the excerpt of an approved standalone Risk Acceptability Policy document, recorded acceptance thresholds, or documented device-family-specific principles.
