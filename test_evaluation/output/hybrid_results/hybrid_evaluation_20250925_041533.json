A process diagram (Figure 1), references to Design Control (QAP012), document control (QAP001), training (QAP011) and post\u2011market activities are present. However, there are a small number of incomplete cross\u2011references and missing administrative evidence (e.g., placeholder references like 'XX-XXX'/'XX-YYY', no visible approval/signature metadata in the excerpt) that should be closed to demonstrate full, auditable integration with the QMS and demonstrate controlled issuance.",

Quotes in the SOP explicitly require that criteria be based on regulations/standards and state of the art. However, the SOP does not contain a single, explicit, approved 'Risk Acceptability Policy' document or a concrete set of acceptability thresholds within the procedure itself. The SOP intentionally defers numeric thresholds to product-specific RMPs and to top management decisions, and does not provide device-family specific principles or examples in the SOP (only that RMP should define them).
