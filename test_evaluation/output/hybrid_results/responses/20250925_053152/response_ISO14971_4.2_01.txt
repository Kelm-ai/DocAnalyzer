  "rationale": "The QAP013.01 Risk Management Program SOP clearly documents top‑management responsibilities and expectations for providing resources and assigning competent personnel (therefore showing documented management commitment in procedure form). However, the excerpt does not include the required corroborating artifacts (e.g., management review minutes, org chart, resource plans, training records) that demonstrate that top management has actually committed resources and assigned competent personnel in practice. Per the acceptance criteria, both documented commitment (procedural) and actual artifacts (management review records, resourcing decisions, training plans/records, org charts) are expected. The SOP meets the procedural evidence but the concrete artifacts are absent from the provided excerpt, so full conformance cannot be confirmed.",

    "Page 4, Role Responsibility - Functional Area Management: \"Ensures provision of adequate resources and assignment of competent personnel for risk management\"",

  "gaps": [
    "No management review minutes or records provided to evidence active top-management review and resourcing decisions (e.g., minutes that show resourcing decisions or risk review outcomes).",
    "No organizational chart or role assignment document showing formal assignment of personnel to risk management roles and their reporting lines.",
    "No resource plan or budgetary documentation demonstrating allocation of adequate resources for risk management activities.",
    "No training plan or training records (evidence of completed training/competency assessments) linked to QAP011 for personnel performing risk management tasks.",
    "No records of top management approval signatures or documented decisions (e.g., signed Risk Management Report, management review action items) included in the excerpt.",

  "recommendations": [
    "Provide management review records (minutes) that demonstrate top management reviewed the risk management process and made or recorded resourcing decisions and action items. Include dates, attendees, decisions, and action owners.",
    "Attach an organizational chart and/or role assignment matrix that shows named or functionally assigned personnel responsible for risk management activities and their reporting lines.",
    "Provide a resource plan or evidence of budget/allocation for risk management activities (staffing FTEs, external consultants, tools/licenses) demonstrating adequacy of resources.",
    "Supply training program documentation and evidence of personnel competence: the QAP011 training plan plus completed training records, competency assessments, or qualifications for individuals who conduct formal risk analyses.",
    "Include signed Risk Management Report(s) or documented approvals by top management (Product Development, Clinical Development, Regulatory Affairs, QA) where applicable, showing explicit approval of residual risks and benefit‑risk decisions.",
    "Link or provide the referenced Management Responsibility procedure (XX-YYY) and evidence that its management review outputs include risk-management items (e.g., a management review agenda that includes 'risk management process' and the records of that review).",
    "Where resource assignment is shared with external partners (design partners, CMOs), provide contracts or documented agreements showing responsibility/commitment and evidence that top management reviewed/approved those arrangements."
