  "rationale": "The submitted QAP013.01 Risk Management Program SOP clearly establishes, documents and describes an ongoing risk management process across the device life cycle and includes the required elements of ISO 14971 (risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, production and post‑production activities). A process diagram (Figure 1), references to Design Control (QAP012), document control (QAP001), training (QAP011) and post‑market activities are present. However, there are a small number of incomplete cross‑references and missing administrative evidence (e.g., placeholder references like 'XX-XXX'/'XX-YYY', no visible approval/signature metadata in the excerpt) that should be closed to demonstrate full, auditable integration with the QMS and demonstrate controlled issuance.",
  "evidence": [
    "Purpose: \"The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish, implement, document and maintain an ongoing process for risk management at Viking Therapeutics for combination products...\" (Section 1.1)",
    "Scope: \"This SOP applies to the commercial and investigational (clinical) combination products... throughout the product lifecycle phases, including product development, technology and design transfer, manufacturing, product surveillance and product discontinuation.\" (Section 1.2)",
    "Procedure elements: \"The risk management process includes the following elements throughout the product life cycle: 5.1.4.1. Identifying hazards and hazardous situations... 5.1.4.2. Estimating and evaluating the associated risks... 5.1.4.3. Controlling risk and monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures... 5.1.4.4. Monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures... 5.1.4.6. Periodic review of identified risks.\" (Section 5.1.4)",
    "Integration with product realization: \"Risk management is integrated within QAP012, Design Control as part of product realization.\" (Section 5.1.2)",
    "Production/post-production: Section header and content: \"5.12. Production and Post-Production Activities\" and details on active collection and review of production/post-production information (Sections 5.12.1–5.12.5)",
    "Process flowchart: \"Figure 1. Risk Management Overview\" referenced and included in the attachment (visual evidence)",
    "Document control & RM file location: \"The contents of the risk management file... shall be controlled and maintained in the document management system in accordance with QAP001, Format, Content, Approval and Issuance of Controlled Documents.\" (Section 5.3.5)",
    "Incomplete cross-references: Examples include placeholders: \"Partners... shall be evaluated and approved in accordance with XX -XXX, Supplier Qualification and Management.\" (Section 1.4) and \"in accordance with the Management Review Process specified in XX- YYY, Management Responsibility.\" (Section 5.1.6/5.13.3)"
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "Placeholder cross-references (e.g., 'XX-XXX', 'XX-YYY') appear in multiple locations referencing Supplier Qualification/Management and Management Responsibility. These should be resolved to specific controlled procedure identifiers to ensure traceability.",
    "No explicit approval / signature / controlled issuance metadata visible in the provided excerpt (e.g., approver name, role, approval date, document owner). QAP001 is referenced but evidence of this document's application to QAP013.01 (signed/approved record) is not shown in the materials reviewed.",
    "Risk acceptance thresholds are described as established by top management and may be defined in the Risk Management Plan, but the SOP itself (or accompanying RMP template) does not contain example or default acceptance criteria. Evidence that specific product Risk Management Plans consistently capture the acceptance criteria (and where they are stored) was not presented.",
    "Although integration with Design Control (QAP012) and other QMS processes is stated, the excerpt does not show explicit pointers to the Quality Manual / centralized cross‑reference table demonstrating how RM activities feed into related QMS records (e.g., change control, CAPA, supplier qualification) beyond individual references.",
    "No explicit mention in the excerpt of the controlled location (document ID/path) or versioning/retention rules for the figure (Figure 1) and templates — although a document management procedure is referenced, direct evidence of the figure/template being under control is not shown."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Replace all placeholder cross-references ('XX-XXX', 'XX-YYY', etc.) with the final, controlled procedure identifiers and ensure links or references point to the current controlled documents in the document management system.",
    "Include/attach documented evidence of controlled issuance for QAP013.01 in the risk management file (or provide a cover page) showing approver(s), effective date, version/revision number, and document owner to demonstrate the procedure is formally approved and controlled per QAP001.",
    "Ensure Risk Management Plans (RMPs) reference and record the specific risk acceptability criteria (or provide the RMP template location) and confirm that top management accepted thresholds are documented and auditable. If thresholds are product- or context-specific, require the RMP to state where the acceptance criteria are defined.",
    "Provide or reference a QMS cross‑reference table or the Quality Manual section that explicitly maps how the RM process integrates with Design Control (QAP012), Supplier Qualification, Change Control, CAPA, Complaint Handling and Management Review, and ensure those procedures reference back to QAP013.01 where appropriate.",
    "Ensure that Figure 1, any templates (Hazard Analysis, FMEA), and appendix forms are maintained as controlled documents (with IDs/revision history) and store them in the Risk Management File/DHF; include the template IDs in the SOP for direct traceability.",
    "During the next periodic management review, present evidence that the procedure is being implemented (sample RMP, hazard analysis, RM report, sign‑offs) to demonstrate operational effectiveness and closure of the above gaps."
