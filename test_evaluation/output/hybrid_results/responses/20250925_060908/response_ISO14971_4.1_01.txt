  "rationale": "A controlled Risk Management SOP (QAP013.01) exists and explicitly establishes, implements, documents, and maintains an ongoing process across the product lifecycle. It integrates with product realization (Design Control) and covers risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, and production/post‑production activities. A process overview/flow is referenced and depicted (Figure 1). Clear cross‑references to related QMS processes are provided.",

    "Section 5.1.5: \"Figure 1 illustrates the systemic representation of the risk management process.\" Confirmed the flowchart is present and shows risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, overall residual risk evaluation, and production/post‑production activities. (Page 8, Figure 1)",

  "gaps": [
    "References include a likely typo: \"ISO 12971: 2020\" instead of ISO/TR 24971:2020 (Section 3).",

  "recommendations": [
    "Correct the reference list to ISO/TR 24971:2020 and ensure consistency across the document.",

    "Add the controlled document identifier for the Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process.",
    "Ensure Figure 1 remains maintained as a controlled depiction of the process steps and aligns with the described lifecycle elements."
