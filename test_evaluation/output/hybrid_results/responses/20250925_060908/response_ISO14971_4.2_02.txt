  "status": "PASS",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "rationale": "QAP013.01 functions as the organization's policy and procedure for establishing risk acceptability criteria. It assigns ownership to top management and QA, requires criteria to be defined in each Risk Management Plan, explicitly bases acceptance on regulations, relevant standards, state of the art, and stakeholder concerns, and includes direction on evaluating overall residual risk. While the SOP intentionally does not fix universal thresholds, ISO 14971:2019 4.2 requires a policy for establishing criteria, not necessarily fixed values. The SOP also ensures accessibility via the document management system and DHF. Minor editorial gaps do not undermine compliance.",
  "evidence": [
    "Responsibilities – Functional Area Management (Page 4): \"Defines and documents criteria for risk acceptability in the Risk Management Procedure... based upon applicable national or regional regulations and relevant International Standards and considers... state of the art and known stakeholder concerns.\"",
    "Responsibilities – Quality Assurance (Page 5): \"Defines and documents criteria for risk acceptability in the Risk Management Plan according to the process established in this SOP.\"",
    "5.2.5 Risk Management Plan (Page 9): \"Categories of risk and criteria for risk acceptability... The risk acceptance criteria are based on... (1) current standard of care, (2) potential health benefits, (3) generally acknowledged state of the art... consensus standards.\"",
    "5.2.6 Risk Management Plan (Page 9): \"The evaluation method and criteria for acceptability for the overall residual risk... shall be clearly defined and documented in the risk management plan.\"",
    "5.8.1 Risk Evaluation (Page 16): \"...evaluate estimated risks to determine whether the risk is acceptable, using criteria for risk acceptability defined in the risk management plan.\"",
    "5.10.1 Evaluation of Residual Risk (Page 18–19): \"...evaluate the overall residual risk... using the method and the criteria for acceptability of the overall residual risk defined in the risk management plan.\"",

    "5.3.5–5.3.6 Risk Management File (Page 10–11): \"controlled and maintained in the document management system... maintained in the... DHF\" (accessibility to teams).",
    "1.3 Purpose/Scope (Page 3): \"This SOP does not define the threshold for acceptable risk (or risk index) since this threshold will change based on the intended use and expected benefit...\" (confirms policy to establish criteria per product rather than universal thresholds)."

  "gaps": [
    "No standalone corporate Risk Acceptability Policy document; the policy is embedded within the SOP and RMP requirements.",
    "References list includes a likely typo/outdated citation \"ISO 12971: 2020\" instead of ISO/TR 24971:2020 and also references \"ISO 62366: 2005\" rather than IEC 62366-1:2015+A1:2020.",
    "The policy relies on product-specific RMPs for explicit thresholds; the SOP does not include a consolidated corporate statement of acceptability bands or color-to-acceptability definitions, although Table 6 implies actions.",
    "Stakeholder concerns are mentioned as an input but the SOP does not describe a mechanism to systematically gather or review stakeholder concerns during criteria setting.",
    "Minor inconsistency in Table 2 P2 ranges (text repeats \"up to 1 out of 10,000\" across two rows), which could create ambiguity if used directly."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Issue a brief standalone Risk Acceptability Policy or add a dedicated section in QAP013 that summarizes corporate principles, governance, and expected acceptability bands/matrices, including explicit treatment of Green/Yellow/Red as acceptable/conditionally acceptable/unacceptable without justification.",
    "Correct references: replace \"ISO 12971: 2020\" with \"ISO/TR 24971:2020\" and update \"ISO 62366: 2005\" to \"IEC 62366-1:2015+A1:2020\".",
    "Ensure the RMP template includes explicit fields to document: (a) device-family specific criteria; (b) overall residual risk acceptability method; (c) references to applicable regulations/standards/state of the art; and (d) stakeholder input considered.",
    "Clarify and correct Table 2 (P2) frequency ranges to eliminate overlap/duplication and avoid misinterpretation.",
    "Document a simple mechanism to capture and consider stakeholder concerns (e.g., inputs from PMCF/PMS, VOC, KOL feedback) when setting risk acceptability criteria in RMPs."
