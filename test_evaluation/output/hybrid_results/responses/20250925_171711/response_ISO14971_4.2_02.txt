  "rationale": "QAP013.01 functions as the organization’s risk acceptability policy. It assigns management responsibility to define and document risk acceptability criteria, requires that criteria be based on regulations, relevant standards, state of the art, and stakeholder concerns, and mandates product- or family-specific criteria within each Risk Management Plan (RMP). It also provides guidance for evaluating overall residual risk and action-based acceptability via the risk index and Table 6. The document is a controlled, effective SOP, ensuring accessibility to teams through the document management system.",

  "gaps": [
    "The SOP states it does not define risk acceptability thresholds at the procedure level; while it prescribes defining them in each RMP, it does not explicitly label Green/Yellow/Red as Acceptable/ALARP/Unacceptable.",
    "No explicit statement that top management formally approves the risk acceptability policy itself (though top management approval is required when benefit‑risk justifies release).",
    "Reference list includes a likely typo: \"ISO 12971:2020\" instead of ISO/TR 24971:2020 (the guidance document).",
    "Methodology for determining overall residual risk is delegated to the RMP without a standard default method described in the SOP."

  "recommendations": [
    "Add a concise, explicit Risk Acceptability Policy section that maps the Risk Index colors to acceptability categories (e.g., Green = acceptable, Yellow = conditionally acceptable with further controls/benefit‑risk, Red = unacceptable unless justified) and references required actions.",

    "Correct the reference list to ISO/TR 24971:2020 and ensure consistency with mentions elsewhere in the SOP.",

    "Ensure each RMP explicitly cites this SOP section as the Risk Acceptability Policy and documents product- or family-specific thresholds and overall residual risk criteria."
