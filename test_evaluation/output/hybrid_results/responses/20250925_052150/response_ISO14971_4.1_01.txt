  "rationale": "The submitted QAP013.01 Risk Management Program SOP establishes, implements, documents and requires maintenance of an ongoing risk management process that covers the product lifecycle and includes risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk control, and production & post-production activities. Evidence of a process flowchart (Figure 1) and cross-references to QMS documents (QAP012 Design Control, QAP001 Document Control, QAP011 Training Program, Post Market Surveillance / Complaint Handling) are present. However, some cross‑references use placeholders (e.g., \"XX-XXX\", \"XX-YYY\") and the SOP explicitly states it does not define specific thresholds for acceptable risk (section 1.3), deferring those to top management / the Risk Management Plan. Because of these incomplete references and the lack of clearly documented numeric/definitive risk acceptability criteria within the SOP itself, the acceptance criteria are only partially satisfied and require closure actions.",

  "gaps": [
    "Several cross-references use placeholder identifiers (e.g., \"XX-XXX\", \"XX-YYY\") instead of finished document IDs, reducing clarity of QMS linkages.",
    "The SOP explicitly states it does not define thresholds for acceptable risk (Section 1.3) and does not include numeric or specific risk acceptability criteria within the SOP itself; it defers these to top management/Risk Management Plan but does not show a finalized, controlled location for those criteria in the excerpt.",
    "Although the process map (Figure 1) is present, the SOP does not include in-text details showing where the process flow is controlled/versioned in the document management system (figure is present but ensure figure is controlled and legible in the controlled document).",
    "No explicit citation in the excerpt of where the finalized Risk Management Plan template or the Quality Manual states the integrated QMS mapping (though several QAP references are present).",

  "recommendations": [
    "Replace all placeholder cross-references (e.g., \"XX-XXX\", \"XX-YYY\") with the final, controlled document identifiers so cross‑references to Supplier Qualification, Management Responsibility, and other QMS processes are unambiguous.",
    "Document and include (or reference a controlled location for) the organization’s defined risk acceptance criteria or an explicit pointer to the Risk Management Plan that contains the acceptance criteria. If thresholds must be product-specific, include the process for establishing and approving those thresholds (who, when, where) in the SOP or in the Risk Management Plan, and ensure those records are indexed in the Risk Management File.",
    "Confirm and document that Figure 1 (Risk Management Overview) is part of the controlled SOP (with revision/version) and is legible in the controlled record; if not, insert a controlled/high-resolution figure in the SOP file and reference its version.",
    "Ensure the SOP explicitly references the Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling procedure/document identifier (or add it to the references list) to close the traceability to production & post-production processes.",
    "Include a short clause or a cross-reference to the Quality Manual or other QMS document that maps how risk management activities integrate with Design Control, Document Control, Training, Supplier Management, and Management Review (or ensure the Quality Manual contains that mapping and cite it by document number).",
    "Maintain evidence of approval by top management of the SOP and the defined risk acceptability approach, and store that approval record in the Risk Management File."
