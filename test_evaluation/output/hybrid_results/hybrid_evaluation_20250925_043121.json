These elements satisfy ISO 14971:2019 Clause 4.1 requirements in principle. A small number of administrative/traceability gaps were identified (placeholder references, and clarification that risk acceptability criteria must be captured in individual Risk Management Plans) which should be resolved to ensure fully auditable linkage to the QMS and unambiguous acceptance criteria.",
