## Background

### Risk management is a process to identify, assess and control risks that affect the quality or safety of a combination product.  The risk management process is intended to identify and manage quality risks or hazards that can potentially lead to patient or user harm.  Outputs from this process may be inputs to other quality processes.

### Risk management is integrated within the Design Control Procedure [3] as part of product realization.  The Risk Management File and related activities shall be reviewed when design changes are implemented to assure any new risks or changes to existing risks are identified and evaluated.

### Elements of this procedure may be used for combination products in early clinical development to ensure risks to user/patient safety have been evaluated.

### The risk management process includes the following elements throughout the product life cycle.

Identifying hazards and hazardous situations associated with the combination product

Estimating and evaluating the associated risks

Controlling risk and monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures

Monitoring the effectiveness of the risk control measures

Risk reviews driven by new information

Periodic review of identified risks

### Figure 1 illustrates the systemic representation of the risk management process.  Depending on the specific product lifecycle phase, individual elements of risk management can have varying emphasis, but always governed by a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  In addition, risk management activities can be performed iteratively or in multiple steps as appropriate to the combination product.

### As a check on the effectiveness of the risk management processes defined, management shall regularly review the outputs of processes, products, services and the quality system, and make improvements as needed, in accordance with the Management Review Process specified in QA-026, Management Responsibility. [11]

### Documented records, including evidence of decisions and actions taken, shall be maintained to ensure and demonstrate the effective planning, operation and control of this process.

### Persons performing risk management tasks shall have the knowledge and experience appropriate to the tasks assigned to them.  These shall include, where appropriate, knowledge and experience of the particular combination product (or similar products) and its use, the technologies involved, or the risk management techniques.  Appropriate competence and training program requirements are described in QA-019, Training Program [8].

### Risk management tasks may be performed by representatives of several functions, each contributing their specialist knowledge.

### Risk management activities shall be communicated during the product development phases as part of the design review process, and as part of the production and post-production process during the commercialization phase.

### Major risks shall be communicated to Senior Product Development and Quality Assurance Management.

### A risk profile for the combination product shall be established and reviewed periodically.

Figure 1 – Schematic Representation of the Risk Management Process

## Risk Management Plan

### Planning involves specifying processes and associated resources to meet specific objectives.  Factors to consider during the planning phase should align with the organization’s overall business planning and, at a minimum, the type of  combination product being manufactured, intended markets and users, and regulatory requirements.

### Risk management activities shall be planned.

### For the particular combination product (or product family) being considered, a Risk Management Plan shall be documented and shall include the following, at a minimum:

### The scope of the planned risk management activities, identifying and describing the combination product (or product family), intended use, interfaces with external systems or processes, and the lifecycle phases for which each element of the plan is applicable

### Assignment of responsibilities and authorities for the execution of specific risk management activities throughout the product lifecycle shall include:

Identification by function or area of expertise the necessary reviewers, contributors, and personnel responsible for risk management execution throughout the product lifecycle

Top management of Product Development, Clinical Development, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance establish acceptable thresholds for residual risk acceptance within this procedure.

When a product exceeds thresholds, but still has clinical benefit as designed, a benefit risk analysis is required to justify acceptance of risk.

Risk management responsibilities may be shared with design partners, consultants, contract manufacturers or suppliers, if applicable.  The risk management plan shall identify the shared risk management activities, responsible party(ies), controlling procedure(s) and controlling location(s)/documentation system(s).

### Requirements for review of risk management activities throughout the product lifecycle.

### The Design and Development Plan should detail when risk reviews will occur for the specific combination product. The requirements for the review of risk management are contained in WI-PD-006, Design Review Work Instruction [12] and PD-001, Design Control Procedure [3].

### Categories of risk and criteria for risk acceptability, in accordance with this procedure, including criteria for accepting risks when the probability of occurrence of harm cannot be estimated. The risk acceptance criteria is based on the following decisions:

The risk presented by the current standard of care

The potential health benefits of using the combination product

The generally acknowledged state of the art defined in recognized consensus standards

### The evaluation method and criteria for acceptability for the overall residual risk, considering all the impact of all risks together, shall be clearly defined and documented in the Risk Management Plan.

### Verification and/or validation activities required to verify effectiveness of risk control measures.

### At a minimum, data from design verification and design validation activities shall be used as part of the residual risk analysis.

### Other potential sources of verification/validation information include, but are not limited to:

Scientifically valid characterization studies

### Method(s) for obtaining and reviewing relevant product-specific production and post-production information, including requirements for documentation of decisions, based on a risk analysis, with regards to post-market surveillance activities appropriate for the product.

### At a minimum, data from the complaint handling process, if applicable, shall be used as part of the residual risk analysis. Potential sources of post-production information may include, but are not limited to:

Commercial & Clinical complaints (if applicable)

Manufacturing and process performance data

### The risk management plan should include documentation of decisions, based on risk analysis, about what sort of post-market surveillance is appropriate for the  combination product. For example, whether reactive surveillance is adequate or whether proactive studies are needed.

### The risk management plan may be developed for a specific product or for a family of similar products, as appropriate.

### Unplanned risk management activities (ad hoc) may be required during the product lifecycle.  These unplanned activities shall comply with this procedure and shall be included in the Risk Management File.

### The risk management plan shall be reviewed periodically at specified time intervals.  The review shall be conducted to ensure the plan content is accurate, current and compliant with requirements in this procedure, and that the risk management plan has been implemented appropriately.

### During product development, the risk management plan review requirements shall be specified in the Design and Development Plan.  After the product is released to market, the risk management file shall be reviewed.

### The risk management plan shall be included as part of the risk management file.  If the plan changes during the product lifecycle, a record of the changes shall be maintained in the risk management file.

## Risk Management File

### For the combination product being considered, a risk management file shall be established and maintained throughout the product lifecycle.

### All risk management activities executed throughout the product lifecycle shall be included in the risk management file.

### The risk management file shall provide traceability to each identified hazard to the following.

Risk analysis

Risk evaluation

Implementation and verification of the risk control measures

Results of the evaluation of residual risks

### The risk management file may physically contain all records and associated documents produced by risk management activities or may be in the form of an index that contains references to the records and associated documents.  The risk management file consists of the following deliverables, at a minimum:

Hazards Analysis

Master Harms and Severity List

Risk Management Plan

Risk Analyses (internal and external)

Benefit Risk Analysis (when applicable)

Risk Management Report(s)

Post-production Risk Management Report(s) (when appropriate)

### The contents of the risk management file (documents, records, trace items, etc.) shall be controlled and maintained in the document management system in accordance with QA-018[7], QA-021[9] and QA-024[10].

### The risk management file shall be maintained in the associated  combination product design history file (DHF).

## Master Harms and Severity List

### This document provides the severity assignments for identified harms based on the potential health and environmental consequences.  The risk management plan may identify or plan for the development of a Master Harms and Severity List that maps specific harms related to the intended use of the  combination product (or product family) into severity levels based on the potential health and environmental consequences defined in this procedure.  When the risk management plan directs the development of the Master Harms and Severity List, it shall specify the approval requirements for the list. Clinical Development shall be involved in the development, review and approval of the list.

## Criteria for Verification of Risk Controls

### Verification that a risk control has been implemented into the design is conducted in accordance with the Design Verification procedure. Refer to PD-001, Design Control Procedure [7] and WI-PD-003, Design Verification Work Instruction [13] for more information.

### The mechanism to develop the risk-based acceptance criteria for design verification shall be defined in the risk management plan.  The risk management plan shall associate each risk index with a specified level of reliability (also known as the probability content) and statistical confidence.

### Verification that the risk control is effective is conducted in accordance with PD-001, Design Control Procedure [8], WI-PD-003, Design Verification Work Instruction [13] and WI-PD-004, Design Validation Work Instruction [14].

### Verification that the risk control remains effective is conducted per Section 9.0, Periodic Reviews of this procedure.

## Risk Analysis

### Risk Analysis Process

The purpose of the risk analysis is as follows.

Identify all reasonably foreseeable and/or known hazards, hazardous situations, causes, foreseeable sequences of events and associated harms (reference ISO/TR 24971:2020 Annex A for examples)

Estimate the probability of the occurrence and severity of the harms in order to estimate risk

Identify the risk controls necessary to mitigate and control risk

Estimate the reduction or elimination of the probability of occurrence due to the implementation of the risk controls.

The risk analysis shall take into consideration the intended use, the user(s) and the use environment for the combination product.

If a risk analysis, or other relevant information, is available for a similar  combination product, that analysis or information may be used as a starting point for a new analysis.  The degree of relevance depends on the differences between the devices and whether these introduce new hazards or significant differences in outputs, characteristics, performance or results.  The extent of use of an existing analysis is also based on the systematic evaluation of the effects the changes have on the development of hazardous situations.

At a minimum, a usability risk analysis and a system risk analysis are required.  The risk management plan may specify additional risk analysis (i.e., process) as appropriate.

The usability risk analysis is used to analyze the risk of the use of the combination product.

The system risk analysis is used to analyze the risk of the design and/or manufacture of the combination product (as specified in the scope of the risk management plan).

The usability and system risk analyses utilize the same basic structure and methods of risk estimation.

The documentation describing the execution and results of the risk analysis shall include the following, at a minimum.

Identification and description of the combination product that was analyzed

Identification of the person(s) and organization(s) who carried out the risk analysis

Scope and date of the risk analysis

Risk analyses shall be conducted with the support of a team composed of subject matter experts with expertise on the subject being analyzed.  Expertise provided by each team member shall be documented.

Severity, likelihood and (optionally) detection ratings shall be defined in applicable risk management work instructions or procedures based on the scope of the risk analysis (i.e., usability, system, process).  Use of alternate definitions from those established in the associated procedures may be acceptable with proper justification and approval from Quality Assurance.  Any alternative definitions shall be documented in the Risk Management Plan.

### Intended Use, Reasonably Foreseeable Misuse, and Identification of Characteristics Related to the Safety of the Combination product

For the combination product being considered, the Applicant shall document the intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse.  The intended use should consider information such as the intended medical indication, patient population, part of the body or type of tissue interacted with, user profile, use environment, and operating principle. Intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse are documented in the Hazards Analysis and the FMEAs.

The Applicant shall identify and document those qualitative and quantitative characteristics that could affect the safety of the combination product.  Where appropriate, the limits of those characteristic shall be defined.  These characteristics are documented in the Hazards Analysis and FMEAs.

Annex A of ISO 24971:2020 contains identification of hazards and characteristic for safety such as those relating to use that can serve as a guide in identifying combination product characteristics that could have an impact on safety.

Documentation collected during this phase of the risk management project shall be maintained in the risk management file.

### Identification of Hazards

The risk analysis shall identify and document the known and foreseeable hazards associated with the combination product based on the intended use, reasonably foreseeable misuse and the characteristics related to safety in both normal and fault conditions.

Hazards resulting from interfaces with external (to the combination product) systems and processes shall be considered.

For each identified hazard, the reasonably foreseeable sequences or combinations of events that can result in a hazardous situation shall be considered and the hazardous situations shall be identified and documented in the hazards analysis and FMEAs.  Hazard identification methods may include the following:

Review of the same or similar combination products (internally or externally), adverse event (AE) databases, publications, and other sources.  (Similar combination products may include shared subsystems, software code or intended use(s).)

Usability flow chart identifying the steps that shall be performed by the user and the combination product to meet intended use

Known interfaces with external (to the combination product) systems and processes (may be documented in the risk management plan).

### Identification of Hazardous Situations

A hazardous situation is a circumstance in which people, property or the environment are exposed to one or more hazard(s) that could cause or lead to harm.  The risk analysis shall identify and document the hazardous situations based on the intended use resulting from reasonably foreseeable sequences of events or cause(s) for each hazard.

The hazardous situation identification documentation shall be maintained in the risk management file.  Hazardous situation identification methods may include the following.

Review of the same or similar combination products (internally or externally), adverse event (AE) databases, publications and other sources.  (Similar combination products may include shared subsystems, software code or intended use(s).)

### Identification of Harms

A harm is a physical injury or damage to the health of people, property or the environment.  The risk analysis shall identify and document the harm(s) resulting from the identified hazardous situation(s).

The harm identification documentation shall be maintained in the risk management file.  Harm identification methods may include the following.

Review of the same or similar combination products (internally or externally), adverse event (AE) databases, publications and other sources.  (Similar combination products may include shared subsystems, software code or intended use(s).)

Review of identified hazards and hazardous situations

Expert medical opinion (as applicable)

### Reasonably Foreseeable Sequence of Events or Cause(s)

A reasonably foreseeable sequence of events or cause(s) is the process that results in a hazardous situation (exposure to a hazard).  The risk analysis shall identify and document sequences of events or cause(s) for each hazard that could result in a hazardous situation.Sequences of events are documented in the Hazards Analysis and the FMEAs.

Reasonably Foreseeable sequence of event or cause(s) may include the following:

Faults during use (documented in the Usability Risk Analysis), use faults related to misuse, and intentional misuse shall be considered.

Faults in design (or manufacturing as applicable) or interactions with external systems and processes (documented in the System Risk Analysis)

Hazardous situations may result from no-fault conditions (documented in the System Risk Analysis)

Note:  Sequences of events or cause(s) that relate to both usability and design may be documented in either the Usability or System Risk Analysis, depending on the primary cause(s) of the hazard (Use or System)

## Risk Estimation

### Reasonably foreseeable sequences or combinations of events that can result in a hazardous situation shall be considered and the resulting hazardous situation(s) shall be recorded in the Hazards Analysis and the FMEAs.

### For each identified hazardous situation, the associated risk(s) shall be estimated using available information or data.  For hazardous situations for which the probability of the occurrence of harm cannot be estimated, the possible consequences shall be listed for use in risk evaluation and risk control.  The results of these activities shall be recorded in Hazards Analysis and the FMEAs.

### Risk estimation may be quantitative or qualitative.  Information or data for estimating risks may be obtained from the following sources:

Published standards

Scientific or technical investigations

Field data from similar combination products already in use, including publicly available reports of incidents

Usability tests employing typical users

Clinical evidence

Results of relevant investigations or simulations

Expert opinion

External quality assessment schemes

### Risk has two (2) components, which are the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of harm.  To estimate risk, the occurrence and severity shall first be estimated.

Occurrence is estimated by first estimating two (2) probabilities referred to as P1 and P2.

P1 is the probability that the hazardous situation will occur.

P2 is the probability that the hazardous situation will result in harm.

The overall occurrence is P = P1 x P2.

Methods for estimating occurrence may include the following.

Review of the same or similar combination products (internally or externally), adverse event (AE) databases, publications and other sources.  (Similar combination products may include shared subsystems, software code or intended use(s).)

Use of fault tree analysis (FTA) to decompose the probability estimation

Use of bench data (laboratory) or simulations

Use of data from clinical trials

Use of expert judgement

Whenever possible, the probability of occurrence of harm should be estimated. When the probability of occurrence of harm cannot be estimated, the risk acceptance criteria should be developed based on the following.

If it is not possible to estimate P1, assume that the P1 probability is equal to 1.  If it is not possible to estimate P2, assume that the P2 probability is equal to 1. If these assumptions result in an unacceptable risk, conduct a benefit risk  analysis to determine if the potential risk is acceptable based on the potential benefit of the combination product.

An example of overall occurrence is presented in Table 1. The probability limits listed in this table are the products of P1 and P2.

Table 1 – Overall Occurrence P = (P1 x P2)

Severity is a measure of the consequence(s) of the harm

In general, severity should be assigned based on expert medical judgement or literature review.

Table 2 – Assignment of Severity Level

The Risk Index is assigned based on the estimated occurrence and severity.  Table 3 below defines how the Risk Index is determined.

Table 3 – Example Risk Index Determination

### Any system used for qualitative or quantitative categorization of probability of occurrence of harm or severity of harm shall be recorded in the risk management file.

## Risk Evaluation

### For each identified hazardous situation, the Applicant shall evaluate estimated risks to determine whether the risk is acceptable, using criteria for risk acceptability defined in the risk management plan.  If risk reduction is not required, the only risk control activities that shall be performed are those provided in Section 8.9.6 and the estimated risk shall be treated as residual risk.

## Risk Control

### Risk Reduction

When risk reduction is required, risk control activities, as described in Sections 8.9.2 to 8.9.7 shall be performed.

Risk reduction shall be achieved by any combination of designing for inherent safety and/or implementation of protective measures.

Information for safety, intended for residual risk disclosure, provided to users and patients is not considered a mechanism for reducing risk.

All foreseeable and/or known risk controls shall be identified and included in the applicable risk analysis.

Risk reduction measures shall be defined, when possible, to reduce identified risks.  Risk reduction and/or risk control measures shall be documented in the Hazard Analysis and FMEA documents.

Risks shall be reviewed after risk reduction actions are implemented, or following sufficient monitoring time to accumulate required data, to confirm that the desired risk reduction was achieved.

After all risk control measures have been implemented and the effectiveness of the risk control has been verified, each risk shall be reviewed to establish the residual risk and the overall residual risk of the combination product.

### Risk Control Option Analysis

The Applicant shall identify risk control measure(s) that are appropriate for reducing the risk(s) to an acceptable level.

The Applicant shall use one or more of the following risk control options in the priority listed.

Inherent safety by design

Protective measures in the combination product itself or in the manufacturing process

Information for safety

If implementing option b) or c) above, reasonably practicable control measures to reduce risk should be evaluated to determine if the reduced risk is acceptable.

If, during risk control option analysis, the Applicant determines that required risk reduction is not practicable, a benefit-risk analysis of the residual risk shall be conducted.

The risk control measure(s) selected shall be recorded in the Hazards Analysis and/or the FMEAs.

### Implementation of Risk Control Measures

The Applicant shall ensure implementation of the risk control measures selected from the risk control option analysis.

Implementation of each risk control measure(s) shall be verified, and the results shall be recorded in the Hazards Analysis and/or the FMEAs.  The verification of effectiveness may include validation activities.

### Residual Risk Evaluation

After the risk control measures are implemented, the applicant shall evaluate the residual risk using the criteria for risk acceptability defined in the risk management plan.  The results of this evaluation shall be recorded in the Hazards Analysis and/or the FMEAs.

If a residual risk is deemed unacceptable using these criteria, further risk control measures shall be applied in accordance with Section 8.9.2.

The actions required, based on the residual risk evaluation, are defined in Table 4 below.  The specific action(s) taken will depend on the nature of the risk analysis and the acknowledged industry state of the art technological limitations.

Table 4 – Required Action Based on Residual Risk Evaluation

Based on the strength of the risk control(s) and verification results, the estimation of risk may be reduced; however, information for safety (i.e., labeling) intended for residual risk disclosure, provided to users, shall not be considered a mechanism to reduce risk.

### Benefit-Risk Analysis

A benefit-risk analysis shall be performed to determine the acceptability of each individual risk and the overall residual risk of the combination product.

If a residual risk is deemed unacceptable using the criteria established in the risk management plan and further risk control is not practicable, the Applicant may gather and review data and literature to determine if the benefits of the intended use outweigh this residual risk.

If this evidence does not support the conclusion that the benefits outweigh the residual risk, then the Applicant must modify the combination product or its intended use.

The results of the benefit-risk analysis shall be recorded in the Risk Management Report.

### Risks Arising from Risk Control Measure(s)

The effects of risk control measures shall be reviewed with regard to the following.

If new hazards or hazardous situations are introduced

If the estimated risks for previously identified hazardous situations are affected by the introduction of risk control measures.

Any new or increased risks shall be managed in accordance with this procedure.

The results of this review shall be recorded in the risk management file.

### Completeness of Risk Control

The Applicant shall review the risk control activities to ensure that the risks from all identified hazardous situations have been considered.  Traceability is necessary to demonstrate that the risk management process has been applied and all risk control activities have been completed with respect to each identified hazard.  The details required in Section 8.6.1, for documentation of the conduct and results of a risk analysis, form the basic minimum data set for ensuring traceability and verification of risk control completeness.

The results of this activity shall be recorded in the Risk Management Report.

## Evaluation of Residual Risk

### After all risk control measures have been implemented and verified, the Applicant shall evaluate if the overall residual risk posed by the combination product, taking into account the contributions of all residual risks, in relation to the benefits of the intended use, using the method and the criteria for acceptability of the overall residual risk defined in the risk management plan.

### If the overall residual risk is judged acceptable, the Applicant shall inform users of significant residual risks and shall include the necessary information in the accompanying documentation in order to disclose those residual risks.

### If the overall residual risk is deemed unacceptable in relation to the benefits of the intended use, the Applicant must implement additional risk control measures or modify the combination product or its intended use.

### The results of the overall residual risk evaluation shall be recorded in the Risk Management Report.

## Risk Management Report

### Prior to release for clinical usage or commercial production of the combination product, the Applicant shall review the execution of the risk management plan.  This review shall ensure the following, at a minimum.

The risk management plan has been appropriately implemented

The risk management process has been appropriately implemented in accordance with this procedure

The overall residual risk acceptability and overall benefit risk analysis have been determined

Appropriate methods to collect and review the information in the production and post-production phases have been determined and are in place

Requirements for disclosure of overall and individual residual risks through product labeling and other forms of user communication have been determined

Top management of Product Development, Clinical Development, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance from must approve the Risk Management Report if the benefit risk assessment is needed to justify release of the product according to established risk thresholds.

### The results of this review shall be documented and maintained in the risk management report and included in the risk management file.

## Production and Post-Production Activities

### Information relevant to the combination product shall be actively collected and reviewed in the production and post-production phases to comply with Post Market Surveillance Regulations as well as to use the data to provide input to the Risk Management File for the device being marketed. This information is collected in the Post Market Surveillance and Complaint Handling Process.

### Information collected and reviewed about the combination product shall entail the following considerations, at a minimum.

Information generated during production and monitoring of the production process

Information generated by the user

Information generated by those accountable for the installation, use and maintenance of the combination product (as applicable)

Information generated by the supply chain

Publicly available information

Information related to the generally acknowledged state of the art.

### The information collected shall be reviewed for possible relevance to safety, especially with respect to the following:

Previously unrecognized hazards or hazardous situations are present

An estimated risk arising from a hazardous situation is present

The overall residual risk is no longer acceptable in relation to the benefits of the intended use

The generally acknowledged state of the art has changed

### If any of these conditions occur, the following activities shall be performed.

The risk management file shall be reviewed to determine if reassessment of risks and/or assessment of new risks is necessary.

If a residual risk is no longer acceptable, the impact on previous implemented risk control measures shall be evaluated and should be considered as an input for modification of the combination product

Consider the need for actions regarding combination products on the market

Evaluate the impact on previously implemented risk management activities

Provide the results of the evaluation as an input for the review of suitability of the risk management process by top management, as noted in Section 9.4.

### The results of any production and post-production evaluation(s) shall be recorded in the affected documents in the risk management file which include the Risk Management Plan, Hazards Analysis, FMEAs, and Risk Management Report.

# Periodic Reviews

## Periodic reviews of risk management documentation shall be conducted as a post market activity on an annual basis or as specified by the team and documented in the Risk Management Plan or when events that may impact the original risk management decision occur.  Consider the sales volume or product age when determining the review cycle. These events may be planned (i.e., results of product review, inspections, audits, change control, design reviews, human factors studies, production and post-production information review) or unplanned (i.e., root cause from failure investigations, product recall).

## Periodic review of Risk Management Reports shall be conducted, when elements in the risk management file change, to assess the acceptability of residual risks and the overall residual risk of the combination product.

## The risk management process shall be reviewed as part of the management review following requirements in QA-026, Management Responsibility [11].  At a minimum, the review shall include the following.
